<h1>THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA&mdash;A COMEDY IN CHAPTERS<br />
by Thomas Hardy.</h1>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vitae post-scenia celant.&rdquo;&mdash;Lucretius.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This somewhat frivolous narrative was produced as an interlude between
stories of a more sober design, and it was given the sub-title of a
comedy to indicate&mdash;though not quite accurately&mdash;the aim of
the performance.&nbsp; A high degree of probability was not attempted
in the arrangement of the incidents, and there was expected of the reader
a certain lightness of mood, which should inform him with a good-natured
willingness to accept the production in the spirit in which it was offered.&nbsp;
The characters themselves, however, were meant to be consistent and
human.</p>
<p>On its first appearance the novel suffered, perhaps deservedly, for
what was involved in these intentions&mdash;for its quality of unexpectedness
in particular&mdash;that unforgivable sin in the critic&rsquo;s sight&mdash;the
immediate precursor of &lsquo;Ethelberta&rsquo; having been a purely
rural tale.&nbsp; Moreover, in its choice of medium, and line of perspective,
it undertook a delicate task: to excite interest in a drama&mdash;if
such a dignified word may be used in the connection&mdash;wherein servants
were as important as, or more important than, their masters; wherein
the drawing-room was sketched in many cases from the point of view of
the servants&rsquo; hall.&nbsp; Such a reversal of the social foreground
has, perhaps, since grown more welcome, and readers even of the finer
crusted kind may now be disposed to pardon a writer for presenting the
sons and daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Chickerel as beings who come within
the scope of a congenial regard.</p>

<h2>1. A STREET IN ANGLEBURY&mdash;A HEATH NEAR IT&mdash;INSIDE THE
&lsquo;RED LION&rsquo; INN</h2>
<p>Young Mrs. Petherwin stepped from the door of an old and well-appointed
inn in a Wessex town to take a country walk.&nbsp; By her look and carriage
she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no
worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen; but, as a fact
not generally known, her claim to distinction was rather one of brains
than of blood.&nbsp; She was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in
a large house not his own, and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta
after an infant of title who does not come into the story at all, having
merely furnished Ethelberta&rsquo;s mother with a subject of contemplation.&nbsp;
She became teacher in a school, was praised by examiners, admired by
gentlemen, not admired by gentlewomen, was touched up with accomplishments
by masters who were coaxed into painstaking by her many graces, and,
entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof, was stealthily
married by the son.&nbsp; He, a minor like herself, died from a chill
caught during the wedding tour, and a few weeks later was followed into
the grave by Sir Ralph Petherwin, his unforgiving father, who had bequeathed
his wealth to his wife absolutely.</p>
<p>These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning
all concerned.&nbsp; She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelberta&mdash;who
seemed rather a detached bride than a widow&mdash;and finished her education
by placing her for two or three years in a boarding-school at Bonn.&nbsp;
Latterly she had brought the girl to England to live under her roof
as daughter and companion, the condition attached being that Ethelberta
was never openly to recognize her relations, for reasons which will
hereafter appear.</p>
<p>The elegant young lady, as she had a full right to be called if she
cared for the definition, arrested all the local attention when she
emerged into the summer-evening light with that diadem-and-sceptre bearing&mdash;many
people for reasons of heredity discovering such graces only in those
whose vestibules are lined with ancestral mail, forgetting that a bear
may be taught to dance.&nbsp; While this air of hers lasted, even the
inanimate objects in the street appeared to know that she was there;
but from a way she had of carelessly overthrowing her dignity by versatile
moods, one could not calculate upon its presence to a certainty when
she was round corners or in little lanes which demanded no repression
of animal spirits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well to be sure!&rsquo; exclaimed a milkman, regarding her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We should freeze in our beds if &rsquo;twere not for the sun,
and, dang me! if she isn&rsquo;t a pretty piece.&nbsp; A man could make
a meal between them eyes and chin&mdash;eh, hostler?&nbsp; Odd nation
dang my old sides if he couldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker, who had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke, deposited
them upon the edge of the pavement in front of the inn, and straightened
his back to an excruciating perpendicular.&nbsp; His remarks had been
addressed to a rickety person, wearing a waistcoat of that preternatural
length from the top to the bottom button which prevails among men who
have to do with horses.&nbsp; He was sweeping straws from the carriage-way
beneath the stone arch that formed a passage to the stables behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind the cursing and swearing, or somebody who&rsquo;s
never out of hearing may clap yer name down in his black book,&rsquo;
said the hostler, also pausing, and lifting his eyes to the mullioned
and transomed windows and moulded parapet above him&mdash;not to study
them as features of ancient architecture, but just to give as healthful
a stretch to the eyes as his acquaintance had done to his back.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Michael, a old man like you ought to think about other things,
and not be looking two ways at your time of life.&nbsp; Pouncing upon
young flesh like a carrion crow&mdash;&rsquo;tis a vile thing in a old
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis; and yet &rsquo;tis not, for &rsquo;tis a naterel
taste,&rsquo; said the milkman, again surveying Ethelberta, who had
now paused upon a bridge in full view, to look down the river.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, if a poor needy feller like myself could only catch her
alone when she&rsquo;s dressed up to the nines for some grand party,
and carry her off to some lonely place&mdash;sakes, what a pot of jewels
and goold things I warrant he&rsquo;d find about her!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould
pay en for his trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t dispute the picter; but &rsquo;tis sly and untimely
to think such roguery.&nbsp; Though I&rsquo;ve had thoughts like it,
&rsquo;tis true, about high women&mdash;Lord forgive me for&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that figure of fashion standing there is a widow woman,
so I hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady&mdash;not a penny less than lady.&nbsp; Ay, a thing of
twenty-one or thereabouts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A widow lady and twenty-one.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a backward age
for a body who&rsquo;s so forward in her state of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, be that as &rsquo;twill, here&rsquo;s my showings for
her age.&nbsp; She was about the figure of two or three-and-twenty when
a&rsquo; got off the carriage last night, tired out wi&rsquo; boaming
about the country; and nineteen this morning when she came downstairs
after a sleep round the clock and a clane-washed face: so I thought
to myself, twenty-one, I thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what&rsquo;s the young woman&rsquo;s name, make so bold,
hostler?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and the house were all in a stoor with her and the old
woman, and their boxes and camp-kettles, that they carry to wash in
because hand-basons bain&rsquo;t big enough, and I don&rsquo;t know
what all; and t&rsquo;other folk stopping here were no more than dirt
thencefor&rsquo;ard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ve come out of some noble city a long
way herefrom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there was her hair up in buckle as if she&rsquo;d never
seen a clay-cold man at all.&nbsp; However, to cut a long story short,
all I know besides about &rsquo;em is that the name upon their luggage
is Lady Petherwin, and she&rsquo;s the widow of a city gentleman, who
was a man of valour in the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back,
come out of the door but now?&rsquo; said the milkman, nodding towards
a figure of that description who had just emerged from the inn and trudged
off in the direction taken by the lady&mdash;now out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chap in the gaiters?&nbsp; Chok&rsquo; it all&mdash;why, the
father of that nobleman that you call chap in the gaiters used to be
hand in glove with half the Queen&rsquo;s court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What d&rsquo;ye tell o&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That man&rsquo;s father was one of the mayor and corporation
of Sandbourne, and was that familiar with men of money, that he&rsquo;d
slap &rsquo;em upon the shoulder as you or I or any other poor fool
would the clerk of the parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, what&rsquo;s my lordlin&rsquo;s name, make so bold, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, the toppermost class nowadays have left off the use of
wheels for the good of their constitutions, so they traipse and walk
for many years up foreign hills, where you can see nothing but snow
and fog, till there&rsquo;s no more left to walk up; and if they reach
home alive, and ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got too old and weared out, they
walk and see a little of their own parishes.&nbsp; So they tower about
with a pack and a stick and a clane white pocket-handkerchief over their
hats just as you see he&rsquo;s got on his.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been staying
here a night, and is off now again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man, young man,&rdquo;
I think to myself, &ldquo;if your shoulders were bent like a bandy and
your knees bowed out as mine be, till there is not an inch of straight
bone or gristle in &rsquo;ee, th&rsquo; wouldstn&rsquo;t go doing hard
work for play &rsquo;a b&rsquo;lieve.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, true, upon my song.&nbsp; Such a pain as I have had
in my lynes all this day to be sure; words don&rsquo;t know what shipwreck
I suffer in these lynes o&rsquo; mine&mdash;that they do not!&nbsp;
And what was this young widow lady&rsquo;s maiden name, then, hostler?&nbsp;
Folk have been peeping after her, that&rsquo;s true; but they don&rsquo;t
seem to know much about her family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And while I&rsquo;ve tended horses fifty year that other folk
might straddle &rsquo;em, here I be now not a penny the better!&nbsp;
Often-times, when I see so many good things about, I feel inclined to
help myself in common justice to my pocket.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Work hard and be poor,<br />
Do nothing and get more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I draw in the horns of my mind and think to myself, &ldquo;Forbear,
John Hostler, forbear!&rdquo;&mdash;Her maiden name?&nbsp; Faith, I
don&rsquo;t know the woman&rsquo;s maiden name, though she said to me,
&ldquo;Good evening, John;&rdquo; but I had no memory of ever seeing
her afore&mdash;no, no more than the dead inside church-hatch&mdash;where
I shall soon be likewise&mdash;I had not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, my nabs,&rdquo;
I think to myself, &ldquo;more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More know Tom Fool&mdash;what rambling old canticle is it
you say, hostler?&rsquo; inquired the milkman, lifting his ear.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have it again&mdash;a good saying well spit out is
a Christmas fire to my withered heart.&nbsp; More know Tom Fool&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Than Tom Fool knows,&rsquo; said the hostler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the very feeling I&rsquo;ve feeled
over and over again, hostler, but not in such gifted language.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a thought I&rsquo;ve had in me for years, and never could
lick into shape!&mdash;O-ho-ho-ho!&nbsp; Splendid!&nbsp; Say it again,
hostler, say it again!&nbsp; To hear my own poor notion that had no
name brought into form like that&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; lost
it for the world!&nbsp; More know Tom Fool than&mdash;than&mdash;h-ho-ho-ho-ho!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let your sense o&rsquo; vitness break out in such
uproar, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, or folk will surely think you&rsquo;ve
been laughing at the lady and gentleman.&nbsp; Well, here&rsquo;s at
it again&mdash;Night t&rsquo;ee, Michael.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the hostler
went on with his sweeping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Night t&rsquo;ee, hostler, I must move too,&rsquo; said the
milkman, shouldering his yoke, and walking off; and there reached the
inn in a gradual diminuendo, as he receded up the street, shaking his
head convulsively, &lsquo;More know&mdash;Tom Fool&mdash;than Tom Fool&mdash;ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Red Lion,&rsquo; as the inn or hotel was called which
of late years had become the fashion among tourists, because of the
absence from its precincts of all that was fashionable and new, stood
near the middle of the town, and formed a corner where in winter the
winds whistled and assembled their forces previous to plunging helter-skelter
along the streets.&nbsp; In summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot,
convenient for such quiet characters as sojourned there to study the
geology and beautiful natural features of the country round.</p>
<p>The lady whose appearance had asserted a difference between herself
and the Anglebury people, without too clearly showing what that difference
was, passed out of the town in a few moments and, following the highway
across meadows fed by the Froom, she crossed the railway and soon got
into a lonely heath.&nbsp; She had been watching the base of a cloud
as it closed down upon the line of a distant ridge, like an upper upon
a lower eyelid, shutting in the gaze of the evening sun.&nbsp; She was
about to return before dusk came on, when she heard a commotion in the
air immediately behind and above her head.&nbsp; The saunterer looked
up and saw a wild-duck flying along with the greatest violence, just
in its rear being another large bird, which a countryman would have
pronounced to be one of the biggest duck-hawks that he had ever beheld.&nbsp;
The hawk neared its intended victim, and the duck screamed and redoubled
its efforts.</p>
<p>Ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have
made a little dog bark with delight and run after, her object being,
if possible, to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so
small and unheard-of.&nbsp; Her stateliness went away, and it could
be forgiven for not remaining; for her feet suddenly became as quick
as fingers, and she raced along over the uneven ground with such force
of tread that, being a woman slightly heavier than gossamer, her patent
heels punched little D&rsquo;s in the soil with unerring accuracy wherever
it was bare, crippled the heather-twigs where it was not, and sucked
the swampy places with a sound of quick kisses.</p>
<p>Her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds,
though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an
open place as that around her, having at one point in the journey been
so near that she could hear the whisk of the duck&rsquo;s feathers against
the wind as it lifted and lowered its wings.&nbsp; When the bird seemed
to be but a few yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards, and
after a level flight of a quarter of a minute, vanish.&nbsp; The hawk
swooped after, and Ethelberta now perceived a whitely shining oval of
still water, looking amid the swarthy level of the heath like a hole
through to a nether sky.</p>
<p>Into this large pond, which the duck had been making towards from
the beginning of its precipitate flight, it had dived out of sight.&nbsp;
The excited and breathless runner was in a few moments close enough
to see the disappointed hawk hovering and floating in the air as if
waiting for the reappearance of its prey, upon which grim pastime it
was so intent that by creeping along softly she was enabled to get very
near the edge of the pool and witness the conclusion of the episode.&nbsp;
Whenever the duck was under the necessity of showing its head to breathe,
the other bird would dart towards it, invariably too late, however;
for the diver was far too experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard
family at this game to come up twice near the same spot, unaccountably
emerging from opposite sides of the pool in succession, and bobbing
again by the time its adversary reached each place, so that at length
the hawk gave up the contest and flew away, a satanic moodiness being
almost perceptible in the motion of its wings.</p>
<p>The young lady now looked around her for the first time, and began
to perceive that she had run a long distance&mdash;very much further
than she had originally intended to come.&nbsp; Her eyes had been so
long fixed upon the hawk, as it soared against the bright and mottled
field of sky, that on regarding the heather and plain again it was as
if she had returned to a half-forgotten region after an absence, and
the whole prospect was darkened to one uniform shade of approaching
night.&nbsp; She began at once to retrace her steps, but having been
indiscriminately wheeling round the pond to get a good view of the performance,
and having followed no path thither, she found the proper direction
of her journey to be a matter of some uncertainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; she said to herself, &lsquo;I faced the north
at starting:&rsquo; and yet on walking now with her back where her face
had been set, she did not approach any marks on the horizon which might
seem to signify the town.&nbsp; Thus dubiously, but with little real
concern, she walked on till the evening light began to turn to dusk,
and the shadows to darkness.</p>
<p>Presently in front of her Ethelberta saw a white spot in the shade,
and it proved to be in some way attached to the head of a man who was
coming towards her out of a slight depression in the ground.&nbsp; It
was as yet too early in the evening to be afraid, but it was too late
to be altogether courageous; and with balanced sensations Ethelberta
kept her eye sharply upon him as he rose by degrees into view.&nbsp;
The peculiar arrangement of his hat and pugree soon struck her as being
that she had casually noticed on a peg in one of the rooms of the &lsquo;Red
Lion,&rsquo; and when he came close she saw that his arms diminished
to a peculiar smallness at their junction with his shoulders, like those
of a doll, which was explained by their being girt round at that point
with the straps of a knapsack that he carried behind him.&nbsp; Encouraged
by the probability that he, like herself, was staying or had been staying
at the &lsquo;Red Lion,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Can you tell me if this
is the way back to Anglebury?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is one way; but the nearest is in this direction,&rsquo;
said the tourist&mdash;the same who had been criticized by the two old
men.</p>
<p>At hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young lady&rsquo;s
person stood still: she stopped like a clock.&nbsp; When she could again
fence with the perception which had caused all this, she breathed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Julian!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; The words were uttered
in a way which would have told anybody in a moment that here lay something
connected with the light of other days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Mrs. Petherwin!&mdash;Yes, I am Mr. Julian&mdash;though
that can matter very little, I should think, after all these years,
and what has passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No remark was returned to this rugged reply, and he continued unconcernedly,
&lsquo;Shall I put you in the path&mdash;it is just here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come with me, then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She walked in silence at his heels, not a word passing between them
all the way: the only noises which came from the two were the brushing
of her dress and his gaiters against the heather, or the smart rap of
a stray flint against his boot.</p>
<p>They had now reached a little knoll, and he turned abruptly: &lsquo;That
is Anglebury&mdash;just where you see those lights.&nbsp; The path down
there is the one you must follow; it leads round the hill yonder and
directly into the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she murmured, and found that he had never
removed his eyes from her since speaking, keeping them fixed with mathematical
exactness upon one point in her face.&nbsp; She moved a little to go
on her way; he moved a little less&mdash;to go on his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said Mr. Julian.</p>
<p>The moment, upon the very face of it, was critical; and yet it was
one of those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite
character as good or bad.</p>
<p>Thus much would have been obvious to any outsider; it may have been
doubly so to Ethelberta, for she gave back more than she had got, replying,
&lsquo;Good-bye&mdash;if you are going to say no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then in struck Mr. Julian: &lsquo;What can I say?&nbsp; You are nothing
to me. . . .&nbsp; I could forgive a woman doing anything for spite,
except marrying for spite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The connection of that with our present meeting does not appear,
unless it refers to what you have done.&nbsp; It does not refer to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not married: you are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not contradict him, as she might have done.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christopher,&rsquo;
she said at last, &lsquo;this is how it is: you knew too much of me
to respect me, and too little to pity me.&nbsp; A half knowledge of
another&rsquo;s life mostly does injustice to the life half known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more, I must
do my best to know you less, and elevate my opinion of your nature by
forgetting what it consists in,&rsquo; he said in a voice from which
all feeling was polished away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I did not know that bitterness had more to do with those
words than judgment, I&mdash;should be&mdash;bitter too!&nbsp; You never
knew half about me; you only knew me as a governess; you little think
what my beginnings were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have guessed.&nbsp; I have many times told myself that your
early life was superior to your position when I first met you.&nbsp;
I think I may say without presumption that I recognize a lady by birth
when I see her, even under reverses of an extreme kind.&nbsp; And certainly
there is this to be said, that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy
home does slightly redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, we are wasting words,&rsquo; he resumed cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is better for us to part as we met, and continue to be the
strangers that we have become to each other.&nbsp; I owe you an apology
for having been betrayed into more feeling than I had a right to show,
and let us part friends.&nbsp; Good night, Mrs. Petherwin, and success
to you.&nbsp; We may meet again, some day, I hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; she said, extending her hand.&nbsp; He
touched it, turned about, and in a short time nothing remained of him
but quick regular brushings against the heather in the deep broad shadow
of the moor.</p>
<p>Ethelberta slowly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out.&nbsp;
This meeting had surprised her in several ways.&nbsp; First, there was
the conjuncture itself; but more than that was the fact that he had
not parted from her with any of the tragic resentment that she had from
time to time imagined for that scene if it ever occurred.&nbsp; Yet
there was really nothing wonderful in this: it is part of the generous
nature of a bachelor to be not indisposed to forgive a portionless sweetheart
who, by marrying elsewhere, has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged
to marry her himself.&nbsp; Ethelberta would have been disappointed
quite had there not been a comforting development of exasperation in
the middle part of his talk; but after all it formed a poor substitute
for the loving hatred she had expected.</p>
<p>When she reached the hotel the lamp over the door showed a face a
little flushed, but the agitation which at first had possessed her was
gone to a mere nothing.&nbsp; In the hall she met a slender woman wearing
a silk dress of that peculiar black which in sunlight proclaims itself
to have once seen better days as a brown, and days even better than
those as a lavender, green, or blue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Menlove,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;did you notice if any
gentleman observed and followed me when I left the hotel to go for a
walk this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady&rsquo;s-maid, thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage
after lovers, put a hand to her forehead to show that there was no mistake
about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect,
and said at last, &lsquo;You once told me, ma&rsquo;am, if you recollect,
that when you were dressed, I was not to go staring out of the window
after you as if you were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round
for sale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I didn&rsquo;t see if anybody followed you this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train
last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;how could I?&rsquo; said Mrs. Menlove&mdash;an
exclamation which was more apposite than her mistress suspected, considering
that the speaker, after retiring from duty, had slipped down her dark
skirt to reveal a light, puffed, and festooned one, put on a hat and
feather, together with several pennyweights of metal in the form of
rings, brooches, and earrings&mdash;all in a time whilst one could count
a hundred&mdash;and enjoyed half-an-hour of prime courtship by an honourable
young waiter of the town, who had proved constant as the magnet to the
pole for the space of the day and a half that she had known him.</p>
<p>Going at once upstairs, Ethelberta ran down the passage, and after
some hesitation softly opened the door of the sitting-room in the best
suite of apartments that the inn could boast of.</p>
<p>In this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles
with green shades.&nbsp; Well knowing, as it seemed, who the intruder
was, she continued her occupation, and her visitor advanced and stood
beside the table.&nbsp; The old lady wore her spectacles low down her
cheek, her glance being depressed to about the slope of her straight
white nose in order to look through them.&nbsp; Her mouth was pursed
up to almost a youthful shape as she formed the letters with her pen,
and a slight move of the lip accompanied every downstroke.&nbsp; There
were two large antique rings on her forefinger, against which the quill
rubbed in moving backwards and forwards, thereby causing a secondary
noise rivalling the primary one of the nib upon the paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; said the younger lady, &lsquo;here I am at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A writer&rsquo;s mind in the midst of a sentence being like a ship
at sea, knowing no rest or comfort till safely piloted into the harbour
of a full stop, Lady Petherwin just replied with &lsquo;What,&rsquo;
in an occupied tone, not rising to interrogation.&nbsp; After signing
her name to the letter, she raised her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, how late you are, Ethelberta, and how heated you look!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been quite alarmed about you.&nbsp; What
do you say has happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great, chief, and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened
was the accidental meeting with an old lover whom she had once quarrelled
with; and Ethelberta&rsquo;s honesty would have delivered the tidings
at once, had not, unfortunately, all the rest of her attributes been
dead against that act, for the old lady&rsquo;s sake even more than
for her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck!&rsquo; she
exclaimed innocently.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I ran after to see what the end
of it would be&mdash;much further than I had any idea of going.&nbsp;
However, the duck came to a pond, and in running round it to see the
end of the fight, I could not remember which way I had come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mercy!&rsquo; said her mother-in-law, lifting her large eyelids,
heavy as window-shutters, and spreading out her fingers like the horns
of a snail.&nbsp; &lsquo;You might have sunk up to your knees and got
lost in that swampy place&mdash;such a time of night, too.&nbsp; What
a tomboy you are!&nbsp; And how did you find your way home after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, some man showed me the way, and then I had no difficulty,
and after that I came along leisurely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you had been running all the way; you look so warm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a warm evening. . . .&nbsp; Yes, and I have been thinking
of old times as I walked along,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and how people&rsquo;s
positions in life alter.&nbsp; Have I not heard you say that while I
was at Bonn, at school, some family that we had known had their household
broken up when the father died, and that the children went away you
didn&rsquo;t know where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean the Julians?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that was the name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course you know it was the Julians.&nbsp; Young Julian
had a day or two&rsquo;s fancy for you one summer, had he not?&mdash;just
after you came to us, at the same time, or just before it, that my poor
boy and you were so desperately attached to each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, I recollect,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
he had a sister, I think.&nbsp; I wonder where they went to live after
the family collapse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said Lady Petherwin, taking up another
sheet of paper.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a dim notion that the son, who had
been brought up to no profession, became a teacher of music in some
country town&mdash;music having always been his hobby.&nbsp; But the
facts are not very distinct in my memory.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she dipped
her pen for another letter.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, with a rather fallen countenance, then left her mother-in-law,
and went where all ladies are supposed to go when they want to torment
their minds in comfort&mdash;to her own room.&nbsp; Here she thoughtfully
sat down awhile, and some time later she rang for her maid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Menlove,&rsquo; she said, without looking towards a rustle
and half a footstep that had just come in at the door, but leaning back
in her chair and speaking towards the corner of the looking-glass, &lsquo;will
you go down and find out if any gentleman named Julian has been staying
in this house?&nbsp; Get to know it, I mean, Menlove, not by directly
inquiring; you have ways of getting to know things, have you not?&nbsp;
If the devoted George were here now, he would help&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George was nothing to me, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;James, then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I only had James for a week or ten days: when I found
he was a married man, I encouraged his addresses very little indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had encouraged him heart and soul, you couldn&rsquo;t
have fumed more at the loss of him.&nbsp; But please to go and make
that inquiry, will you, Menlove?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Ethelberta&rsquo;s woman was back again.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
gentleman of that name stayed here last night, and left this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you find out his address?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now the lady&rsquo;s-maid had already been quick-witted enough to
find out that, and indeed all about him; but it chanced that a fashionable
illustrated weekly paper had just been sent from the bookseller&rsquo;s,
and being in want of a little time to look it over before it reached
her mistress&rsquo;s hands, Mrs. Menlove retired, as if to go and ask
the question&mdash;to stand meanwhile under the gas-lamp in the passage,
inspecting the fascinating engravings.&nbsp; But as time will not wait
for tire-women, a natural length of absence soon elapsed, and she returned
again and said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;His address is, Upper Street, Sandbourne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, that will do,&rsquo; replied her mistress.</p>
<p>The hour grew later, and that dreamy period came round when ladies&rsquo;
fancies, that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day,
begin to assert themselves anew.&nbsp; At this time a good guess at
Ethelberta&rsquo;s thoughts might have been made from her manner of
passing the minutes away.&nbsp; Instead of reading, entering notes in
her diary, or doing any ordinary thing, she walked to and fro, curled
her pretty nether lip within her pretty upper one a great many times,
made a cradle of her locked fingers, and paused with fixed eyes where
the walls of the room set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but
a picture within her mind.</p>
<h2>2. CHRISTOPHER&rsquo;S HOUSE&mdash;SANDBOURNE TOWN&mdash;SANDBOURNE
MOOR</h2>
<p>During the wet autumn of the same year, the postman passed one morning
as usual into a plain street that ran through the less fashionable portion
of Sandbourne, a modern coast town and watering-place not many miles
from the ancient Anglebury.&nbsp; He knocked at the door of a flat-faced
brick house, and it was opened by a slight, thoughtful young man, with
his hat on, just then coming out.&nbsp; The postman put into his hands
a book packet, addressed, &lsquo;Christopher Julian, Esq.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher took the package upstairs, opened it with curiosity,
and discovered within a green volume of poems, by an anonymous writer,
the title-page bearing the inscription, &lsquo;Metres by E.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The book was new, though it was cut, and it appeared to have been looked
into.&nbsp; The young man, after turning it over and wondering where
it came from, laid it on the table and went his way, being in haste
to fulfil his engagements for the day.</p>
<p>In the evening, on returning home from his occupations, he sat himself
down cosily to read the newly-arrived volume.&nbsp; The winds of this
uncertain season were snarling in the chimneys, and drops of rain spat
themselves into the fire, revealing plainly that the young man&rsquo;s
room was not far enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist
in the flue, and revealing darkly a little more, if that social rule-of-three
inverse, the higher in lodgings the lower in pocket, were applicable
here.&nbsp; However, the aspect of the room, though homely, was cheerful,
a somewhat contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection
consisted of waifs and strays from a former home, the grimy faces of
the old articles exercising a curious and subduing effect on the bright
faces of the new.&nbsp; An oval mirror of rococo workmanship, and a
heavy cabinet-piano with a cornice like that of an Egyptian temple,
adjoined a harmonium of yesterday, and a harp that was almost as new.&nbsp;
Printed music of the last century, and manuscript music of the previous
evening, lay there in such quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a
retreat which was indeed only saved from a chronic state of litter by
a pair of hands that sometimes played, with the lightness of breezes,
about the sewing-machine standing in a remote corner&mdash;if any corner
could be called remote in a room so small.</p>
<p>Fire lights and shades from the shaking flames struck in a butterfly
flutter on the underparts of the mantelshelf, and upon the reader&rsquo;s
cheek as he sat.&nbsp; Presently, and all at once, a much greater intentness
pervaded his face: he turned back again, and read anew the subject that
had arrested his eyes.&nbsp; He was a man whose countenance varied with
his mood, though it kept somewhat in the rear of that mood.&nbsp; He
looked sad when he felt almost serene, and only serene when he felt
quite cheerful.&nbsp; It is a habit people acquire who have had repressing
experiences.</p>
<p>A faint smile and flush now lightened his face, and jumping up he
opened the door and exclaimed, &lsquo;Faith! will you come here for
a moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A prompt step was heard on the stairs, and the young person addressed
as Faith entered the room.&nbsp; She was small in figure, and bore less
in the form of her features than in their shades when changing from
expression to expression the evidence that she was his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith&mdash;I want your opinion.&nbsp; But, stop, read this
first.&rsquo;&nbsp; He laid his finger upon a page in the book, and
placed it in her hand.</p>
<p>The girl drew from her pocket a little green-leather sheath, worn
at the edges to whity-brown, and out of that a pair of spectacles, unconsciously
looking round the room for a moment as she did so, as if to ensure that
no stranger saw her in the act of using them.&nbsp; Here a weakness
was uncovered at once; it was a small, pretty, and natural one; indeed,
as weaknesses go in the great world, it might almost have been called
a commendable trait.&nbsp; She then began to read, without sitting down.</p>
<p>These &lsquo;Metres by E.&rsquo; composed a collection of soft and
marvellously musical rhymes, of a nature known as the <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
The lines presented a series of playful defences of the supposed strategy
of womankind in fascination, courtship, and marriage&mdash;the whole
teeming with ideas bright as mirrors and just as unsubstantial, yet
forming a brilliant argument to justify the ways of girls to men.&nbsp;
The pervading characteristic of the mass was the means of forcing into
notice, by strangeness of contrast, the single mournful poem that the
book contained.&nbsp; It was placed at the very end, and under the title
of &lsquo;Cancelled Words,&rsquo; formed a whimsical and rather affecting
love-lament, somewhat in the tone of many of Sir Thomas Wyatt&rsquo;s
poems.&nbsp; This was the piece which had arrested Christopher&rsquo;s
attention, and had been pointed out by him to his sister Faith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very touching,&rsquo; she said, looking up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think I suspect about it&mdash;that the poem is
addressed to me!&nbsp; Do you remember, when father was alive and we
were at Solentsea that season, about a governess who came there with
a Sir Ralph Petherwin and his wife, people with a sickly little daughter
and a grown-up son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw any of them.&nbsp; I think I remember your knowing
something about a young man of that name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that was the family.&nbsp; Well, the governess there
was a very attractive woman, and somehow or other I got more interested
in her than I ought to have done (this is necessary to the history),
and we used to meet in romantic places&mdash;and&mdash;and that kind
of thing, you know.&nbsp; The end of it was, she jilted me and married
the son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were anxious to get away from Solentsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was I?&nbsp; Then that was chiefly the reason.&nbsp; Well,
I decided to think no more of her, and I was helped to do it by the
troubles that came upon us shortly afterwards; it is a blessed arrangement
that one does not feel a sentimental grief at all when additional grief
comes in the shape of practical misfortune.&nbsp; However, on the first
afternoon of the little holiday I took for my walking tour last summer,
I came to Anglebury, and stayed about the neighbourhood for a day or
two to see what it was like, thinking we might settle there if this
place failed us.&nbsp; The next evening I left, and walked across the
heath to Flychett&mdash;that&rsquo;s a village about five miles further
on&mdash;so as to be that distance on my way for next morning; and while
I was crossing the heath there I met this very woman.&nbsp; We talked
a little, because we couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;you may imagine the
kind of talk it was&mdash;and parted as coolly as we had met.&nbsp;
Now this strange book comes to me; and I have a strong conviction that
she is the writer of it, for that poem sketches a similar scene&mdash;or
rather suggests it; and the tone generally seems the kind of thing she
would write&mdash;not that she was a sad woman, either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She seems to be a warm-hearted, impulsive woman, to judge
from these tender verses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People who print very warm words have sometimes very cold
manners.&nbsp; I wonder if it is really her writing, and if she has
sent it to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it not be a singular thing for a married woman to do?&nbsp;
Though of course&rsquo;&mdash;(she removed her spectacles as if they
hindered her from thinking, and hid them under the timepiece till she
should go on reading)&mdash;&lsquo;of course poets have morals and manners
of their own, and custom is no argument with them.&nbsp; I am sure I
would not have sent it to a man for the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see any absolute harm in her sending it.&nbsp; Perhaps
she thinks that, since it is all over, we may as well die friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were her husband I should have doubts about the dying.&nbsp;
And &ldquo;all over&rdquo; may not be so plain to other people as it
is to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; And when a man checks all a woman&rsquo;s
finer sentiments towards him by marrying her, it is only natural that
it should find a vent somewhere.&nbsp; However, she probably does not
know of my downfall since father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I hardly think
she would have cared to do it had she known that.&nbsp; (I am assuming
that it is Ethelberta&mdash;Mrs. Petherwin&mdash;who sends it: of course
I am not sure.)&nbsp; We must remember that when I knew her I was a
gentleman at ease, who had not the least notion that I should have to
work for a living, and not only so, but should have first to invent
a profession to work at out of my old tastes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kit, you have made two mistakes in your thoughts of that lady.&nbsp;
Even though I don&rsquo;t know her, I can show you that.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll
tell you! the first is in thinking that a married lady would send the
book with that poem in it without at any rate a slight doubt as to its
propriety: the second is in supposing that, had she wished to do it,
she would have given the thing up because of our misfortunes.&nbsp;
With a true woman the second reason would have had no effect had she
once got over the first.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a woman, and that&rsquo;s why
I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher said nothing, and turned over the poems.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>He lived by teaching music, and, in comparison with starving, thrived;
though the wealthy might possibly have said that in comparison with
thriving he starved.&nbsp; During this night he hummed airs in bed,
thought he would do for the ballad of the fair poetess what other musicians
had done for the ballads of other fair poetesses, and dreamed that she
smiled on him as her prototype Sappho smiled on Phaon.</p>
<p>The next morning before starting on his rounds a new circumstance
induced him to direct his steps to the bookseller&rsquo;s, and ask a
question.&nbsp; He had found on examining the wrapper of the volume
that it was posted in his own town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No copy of the book has been sold by me,&rsquo; the bookseller&rsquo;s
voice replied from far up the Alpine height of the shop-ladder, where
he stood dusting stale volumes, as was his habit of a morning before
customers came.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never heard of it&mdash;probably
never shall;&rsquo; and he shook out the duster, so as to hit the delicate
mean between stifling Christopher and not stifling him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t live by your shop?&rsquo; said Christopher,
drawing back.</p>
<p>The bookseller&rsquo;s eyes rested on the speaker&rsquo;s; his face
changed; he came down and placed his hand on the lapel of Christopher&rsquo;s
coat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;country bookselling is
a miserable, impoverishing, exasperating thing in these days.&nbsp;
Can you understand the rest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can; I forgive a starving man anything,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You go a long way very suddenly,&rsquo; said the book seller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Half as much pity would have seemed better.&nbsp; However, wait
a moment.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked into a list of new books, and added:
&lsquo;The work you allude to was only published last week; though,
mind you, if it had been published last century I might not have sold
a copy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although his time was precious, Christopher had now become so interested
in the circumstance that the unseen sender was somebody breathing his
own atmosphere, possibly the very writer herself&mdash;the book being
too new to be known&mdash;that he again passed through the blue shadow
of the spire which stretched across the street to-day, and went towards
the post-office, animated by a bright intention&mdash;to ask the postmaster
if he knew the handwriting in which the packet was addressed.</p>
<p>Now the postmaster was an acquaintance of Christopher&rsquo;s, but,
as regarded putting that question to him, there was a difficulty.&nbsp;
Everything turned upon whether the postmaster at the moment of asking
would be in his under-government manner, or in the manner with which
mere nature had endowed him.&nbsp; In the latter case his reply would
be all that could be wished; in the former, a man who had sunk in society
might as well put his tongue into a mousetrap as make an inquiry so
obviously outside the pale of legality as was this.</p>
<p>So he postponed his business for the present, and refrained from
entering till he passed by after dinner, when pleasant malt liquor,
of that capacity for cheering which is expressed by four large letter
X&rsquo;s marching in a row, had refilled the globular trunk of the
postmaster and neutralized some of the effects of officiality.&nbsp;
The time was well chosen, but the inquiry threatened to prove fruitless:
the postmaster had never, to his knowledge, seen the writing before.&nbsp;
Christopher was turning away when a clerk in the background looked up
and stated that some young lady had brought a packet with such an address
upon it into the office two days earlier to get it stamped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know her?&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen her about the neighbourhood.&nbsp; She goes by
every morning; I think she comes into the town from beyond the common,
and returns again between four and five in the afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does she wear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A white wool jacket with zigzags of black braid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher left the post-office and went his way.&nbsp; Among his
other pupils there were two who lived at some distance from Sandbourne&mdash;one
of them in the direction indicated as that habitually taken by the young
person; and in the afternoon, as he returned homeward, Christopher loitered
and looked around.&nbsp; At first he could see nobody; but when about
a mile from the outskirts of the town he discerned a light spot ahead
of him, which actually turned out to be the jacket alluded to.&nbsp;
In due time he met the wearer face to face; she was not Ethelberta Petherwin&mdash;quite
a different sort of individual.&nbsp; He had long made up his mind that
this would be the case, yet he was in some indescribable way disappointed.</p>
<p>Of the two classes into which gentle young women naturally divide,
those who grow red at their weddings, and those who grow pale, the present
one belonged to the former class.&nbsp; She was an April-natured, pink-cheeked
girl, with eyes that would have made any jeweller in England think of
his trade&mdash;one who evidently took her day in the daytime, frequently
caught the early worm, and had little to do with yawns or candlelight.&nbsp;
She came and passed him; he fancied that her countenance changed.&nbsp;
But one may fancy anything, and the pair receded each from each without
turning their heads.&nbsp; He could not speak to her, plain and simple
as she seemed.</p>
<p>It is rarely that a man who can be entered and made to throb by the
channel of his ears is not open to a similar attack through the channel
of his eyes&mdash;for many doors will admit to one mansion&mdash;allowance
being made for the readier capacity of chosen and practised organs.&nbsp;
Hence the beauties, concords, and eloquences of the female form were
never without their effect upon Christopher, a born musician, artist,
poet, seer, mouthpiece&mdash;whichever a translator of Nature&rsquo;s
oracles into simple speech may be called.&nbsp; The young girl who had
gone by was fresh and pleasant; moreover, she was a sort of mysterious
link between himself and the past, which these things were vividly reviving
in him.</p>
<p>The following week Christopher met her again.&nbsp; She had not much
dignity, he had not much reserve, and the sudden resolution to have
a holiday which sometimes impels a plump heart to rise up against a
brain that overweights it was not to be resisted.&nbsp; He just lifted
his hat, and put the only question he could think of as a beginning:
&lsquo;Have I the pleasure of addressing the author of a book of very
melodious poems that was sent me the other day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s forefinger twirled rapidly the loop of braid that
it had previously been twirling slowly, and drawing in her breath, she
said, &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sender, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She somehow presented herself as so insignificant by the combined
effect of the manner and the words that Christopher lowered his method
of address to her level at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;such
an atmosphere as the writer of &ldquo;Metres by E.&rdquo; seems to breathe
would soon spoil cheeks that are fresh and round as lady-apples&mdash;eh,
little girl?&nbsp; But are you disposed to tell me that writer&rsquo;s
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>By applying a general idea to a particular case a person with the
best of intentions may find himself immediately landed in a quandary.&nbsp;
In saying to the country girl before him what would have suited the
mass of country lasses well enough, Christopher had offended her beyond
the cure of compliment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not disposed to tell the writer&rsquo;s name,&rsquo;
she replied, with a dudgeon that was very great for one whose whole
stock of it was a trifle.&nbsp; And she passed on and left him standing
alone.</p>
<p>Thus further conversation was checked; but, through having rearranged
the hours of his country lessons, Christopher met her the next Wednesday,
and the next Friday, and throughout the following week&mdash;no further
words passing between them.&nbsp; For a while she went by very demurely,
apparently mindful of his offence.&nbsp; But effrontery is not proved
to be part of a man&rsquo;s nature till he has been guilty of a second
act: the best of men may commit a first through accident or ignorance&mdash;may
even be betrayed into it by over-zeal for experiment.&nbsp; Some such
conclusion may or may not have been arrived at by the girl with the
lady-apple cheeks; at any rate, after the lapse of another week a new
spectacle presented itself; her redness deepened whenever Christopher
passed her by, and embarrassment pervaded her from the lowest stitch
to the tip of her feather.&nbsp; She had little chance of escaping him
by diverging from the road, for a figure could be seen across the open
ground to the distance of half a mile on either side.&nbsp; One day
as he drew near as usual, she met him as women meet a cloud of dust&mdash;she
turned and looked backwards till he had passed.</p>
<p>This would have been disconcerting but for one reason: Christopher
was ceasing to notice her.&nbsp; He was a man who often, when walking
abroad, and looking as it were at the scene before his eyes, discerned
successes and failures, friends and relations, episodes of childhood,
wedding feasts and funerals, the landscape suffering greatly by these
visions, until it became no more than the patterned wall-tints about
the paintings in a gallery; something necessary to the tone, yet not
regarded.&nbsp; Nothing but a special concentration of himself on externals
could interrupt this habit, and now that her appearance along the way
had changed from a chance to a custom he began to lapse again into the
old trick.&nbsp; He gazed once or twice at her form without seeing it:
he did not notice that she trembled.</p>
<p>He sometimes read as he walked, and book in hand he frequently approached
her now.&nbsp; This went on till six weeks had passed from the time
of their first encounter.&nbsp; Latterly might have been once or twice
heard, when he had moved out of earshot, a sound like a small gasping
sigh; but no arrangements were disturbed, and Christopher continued
to keep down his eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window.</p>
<p>The last day of his engagement had arrived, and with it the last
of his walks that way.&nbsp; On his final return he carried in his hand
a bunch of flowers which had been presented to him at the country-house
where his lessons were given.&nbsp; He was taking them home to his sister
Faith, who prized the lingering blossoms of the seeding season.&nbsp;
Soon appeared as usual his fellow-traveller; whereupon Christopher looked
down upon his nosegay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sweet simple girl,&rsquo; he thought,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll endeavour to make peace with her by means of these
flowers before we part for good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she came up he held them out to her and said, &lsquo;Will you
allow me to present you with these?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bright colours of the nosegay instantly attracted the girl&rsquo;s
hand&mdash;perhaps before there had been time for thought to thoroughly
construe the position; for it happened that when her arm was stretched
into the air she steadied it quickly, and stood with the pose of a statue&mdash;rigid
with uncertainty.&nbsp; But it was too late to refuse: Christopher had
put the nosegay within her fingers.&nbsp; Whatever pleasant expression
of thanks may have appeared in her eyes fell only on the bunch of flowers,
for during the whole transaction they reached to no higher level than
that.&nbsp; To say that he was coming no more seemed scarcely necessary
under the circumstances, and wishing her &lsquo;Good afternoon&rsquo;
very heartily, he passed on.</p>
<p>He had learnt by this time her occupation, which was that of pupil-teacher
at one of the schools in the town, whither she walked daily from a village
near.&nbsp; If he had not been poor and the little teacher humble, Christopher
might possibly have been tempted to inquire more briskly about her,
and who knows how such a pursuit might have ended?&nbsp; But hard externals
rule volatile sentiment, and under these untoward influences the girl
and the book and the truth about its author were matters upon which
he could not afford to expend much time.&nbsp; All Christopher did was
to think now and then of the pretty innocent face and round deep eyes,
not once wondering if the mind which enlivened them ever thought of
him.</p>
<h2>3. SANDBOURNE MOOR (continued)</h2>
<p>It was one of those hostile days of the year when chatterbox ladies
remain miserably in their homes to save the carriage and harness, when
clerks&rsquo; wives hate living in lodgings, when vehicles and people
appear in the street with duplicates of themselves underfoot, when bricklayers,
slaters, and other out-door journeymen sit in a shed and drink beer,
when ducks and drakes play with hilarious delight at their own family
game, or spread out one wing after another in the slower enjoyment of
letting the delicious moisture penetrate to their innermost down.&nbsp;
The smoke from the flues of Sandbourne had barely strength enough to
emerge into the drizzling rain, and hung down the sides of each chimney-pot
like the streamer of a becalmed ship; and a troop of rats might have
rattled down the pipes from roof to basement with less noise than did
the water that day.</p>
<p>On the broad moor beyond the town, where Christopher&rsquo;s meetings
with the teacher had so regularly occurred, were a stream and some large
pools; and beside one of these, near some hatches and a weir, stood
a little square building, not much larger inside than the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
coach.&nbsp; It was known simply as &lsquo;The Weir House.&rsquo;&nbsp;
On this wet afternoon, which was the one following the day of Christopher&rsquo;s
last lesson over the plain, a nearly invisible smoke came from the puny
chimney of the hut.&nbsp; Though the door was closed, sounds of chatting
and mirth fizzed from the interior, and would have told anybody who
had come near&mdash;which nobody did&mdash;that the usually empty shell
was tenanted to-day.</p>
<p>The scene within was a large fire in a fireplace to which the whole
floor of the house was no more than a hearthstone.&nbsp; The occupants
were two gentlemanly persons, in shooting costume, who had been traversing
the moor for miles in search of wild duck and teal, a waterman, and
a small spaniel.&nbsp; In the corner stood their guns, and two or three
wild mallards, which represented the scanty product of their morning&rsquo;s
labour, the iridescent necks of the dead birds replying to every flicker
of the fire.&nbsp; The two sportsmen were smoking, and their man was
mostly occupying himself in poking and stirring the fire with a stick:
all three appeared to be pretty well wetted.</p>
<p>One of the gentlemen, by way of varying the not very exhilarating
study of four brick walls within microscopic distance of his eye, turned
to a small square hole which admitted light and air to the hut, and
looked out upon the dreary prospect before him.&nbsp; The wide concave
of cloud, of the monotonous hue of dull pewter, formed an unbroken hood
over the level from horizon to horizon; beneath it, reflecting its wan
lustre, was the glazed high-road which stretched, hedgeless and ditchless,
past a directing-post where another road joined it, and on to the less
regular ground beyond, lying like a riband unrolled across the scene,
till it vanished over the furthermost undulation.&nbsp; Beside the pools
were occasional tall sheaves of flags and sedge, and about the plain
a few bushes, these forming the only obstructions to a view otherwise
unbroken.</p>
<p>The sportsman&rsquo;s attention was attracted by a figure in a state
of gradual enlargement as it approached along the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think that if pleasure can&rsquo;t tempt a native
out of doors to-day, business will never force him out,&rsquo; he observed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is, for the first time, somebody coming along the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If business don&rsquo;t drag him out pleasure&rsquo;ll never
tempt en, is more like our nater in these parts, sir,&rsquo; said the
man, who was looking into the fire.</p>
<p>The conversation showed no vitality, and down it dropped dead as
before, the man who was standing up continuing to gaze into the moisture.&nbsp;
What had at first appeared as an epicene shape the decreasing space
resolved into a cloaked female under an umbrella: she now relaxed her
pace, till, reaching the directing-post where the road branched into
two, she paused and looked about her.&nbsp; Instead of coming further
she slowly retraced her steps for about a hundred yards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an appointment,&rsquo; said the first speaker,
as he removed the cigar from his lips; &lsquo;and by the lords, what
a day and place for an appointment with a woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s an appointment?&rsquo; inquired his friend, a
town young man, with a Tussaud complexion and well-pencilled brows half
way up his forehead, so that his upper eyelids appeared to possess the
uncommon quality of tallness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look out here, and you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; By that directing-post,
where the two roads meet.&nbsp; As a man devoted to art, Ladywell, who
has had the honour of being hung higher up on the Academy walls than
any other living painter, you should take out your sketch-book and dash
off the scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Where nothing particular is going on, one incident makes a drama;
and, interested in that proportion, the art-sportsman puts up his eyeglass
(a form he adhered to before firing at game that had risen, by which
merciful arrangement the bird got safe off), placed his face beside
his companion&rsquo;s, and also peered through the opening.&nbsp; The
young pupil-teacher&mdash;for she was the object of their scrutiny&mdash;re-approached
the spot whereon she had been accustomed for the last many weeks of
her journey home to meet Christopher, now for the first time missing,
and again she seemed reluctant to pass the hand-post, for that marked
the point where the chance of seeing him ended.&nbsp; She glided backwards
as before, this time keeping her face still to the front, as if trying
to persuade the world at large, and her own shamefacedness, that she
had not yet approached the place at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Query, how long will she wait for him (for it is a man to
a certainty)?&rsquo; resumed the elder of the smokers, at the end of
several minutes of silence, when, full of vacillation and doubt, she
became lost to view behind some bushes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will she reappear?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The smoking went on, and up she came into open ground as before, and
walked by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder who the girl is, to come to such a place in this
weather?&nbsp; There she is again,&rsquo; said the young man called
Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some cottage lass, not yet old enough to make the most of
the value set on her by her follower, small as that appears to be.&nbsp;
Now we may get an idea of the hour named by the fellow for the appointment,
for, depend upon it, the time when she first came&mdash;about five minutes
ago&mdash;was the time he should have been there.&nbsp; It is now getting
on towards five&mdash;half-past four was doubtless the time mentioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not come o&rsquo; purpose: &rsquo;tis her way
home from school every day,&rsquo; said the waterman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An experiment on woman&rsquo;s endurance and patience under
neglect.&nbsp; Two to one against her staying a quarter of an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same odds against her not staying till five would be nearer
probability.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s half-an-hour to a girl in love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On a moorland in wet weather it is thirty perceptible minutes
to any fireside man, woman, or beast in Christendom&mdash;minutes that
can be felt, like the Egyptian plague of darkness.&nbsp; Now, little
girl, go home: he is not worth it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes passed, and the girl returned miserably to the hand-post,
still to wander back to her retreat behind the sedge, and lead any chance
comer from the opposite quarter to believe that she had not yet reached
this ultimate point beyond which a meeting with Christopher was impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;ll find that she means to wait the complete
half-hour, and then off she goes with a broken heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All three now looked through the hole to test the truth of the prognostication.&nbsp;
The hour of five completed itself on their watches; the girl again came
forward.&nbsp; And then the three in ambuscade could see her pull out
her handkerchief and place it to her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s grieving now because he has not come.&nbsp; Poor
little woman, what a brute he must be; for a broken heart in a woman
means a broken vow in a man, as I infer from a thousand instances in
experience, romance, and history.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t open the door till
she is gone, Ladywell; it will only disturb her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they had guessed, the pupil-teacher, hearing the distant town-clock
strike the hour, gave way to her fancy no longer, and launched into
the diverging path.&nbsp; This lingering for Christopher&rsquo;s arrival
had, as is known, been founded on nothing more of the nature of an assignation
than lay in his regular walk along the plain at that time every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday of the six previous weeks.&nbsp; It must be said
that he was very far indeed from divining that his injudicious peace-offering
of the flowers had stirred into life such a wearing, anxious, hopeful,
despairing solicitude as this, which had been latent for some time during
his constant meetings with the little stranger.</p>
<p>She vanished in the mist towards the left, and the loiterers in the
hut began to move and open the door, remarking, &lsquo;Now then for
Wyndway House, a change of clothes, and a dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>4. SANDBOURNE PIER&mdash;ROAD TO WYNDWAY&mdash;BALL-ROOM IN WYNDWAY
HOUSE</h2>
<p>The last light of a winter day had gone down behind the houses of
Sandbourne, and night was shut close over all.&nbsp; Christopher, about
eight o&rsquo;clock, was standing at the end of the pier with his back
towards the open sea, whence the waves were pushing to the shore in
frills and coils that were just rendered visible in all their bleak
instability by the row of lights along the sides of the jetty, the rapid
motion landward of the wavetips producing upon his eye an apparent progress
of the pier out to sea.&nbsp; This pier-head was a spot which Christopher
enjoyed visiting on such moaning and sighing nights as the present,
when the sportive and variegated throng that haunted the pier on autumn
days was no longer there, and he seemed alone with weather and the invincible
sea.</p>
<p>Somebody came towards him along the deserted footway, and rays from
the nearest lamp streaked the face of his sister Faith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Christopher, I knew you were here,&rsquo; she said eagerly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are wanted; there&rsquo;s a servant come from Wyndway House
for you.&nbsp; He is sent to ask if you can come immediately to play
at a little dance they have resolved upon this evening&mdash;quite suddenly
it seems.&nbsp; If you can come, you must bring with you any assistant
you can lay your hands upon at a moment&rsquo;s notice, he says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wyndway House; why should the people send for me above all
other musicians in the town?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith did not know.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you really decide to go,&rsquo;
she said, as they walked homeward, &lsquo;you might take me as your
assistant.&nbsp; I should answer the purpose, should I not, Kit? since
it is only a dance or two they seem to want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your harp I suppose you mean.&nbsp; Yes; you might be
competent to take a part.&nbsp; It cannot be a regular ball; they would
have had the quadrille band for anything of that sort.&nbsp; Faith&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
go.&nbsp; However, let us see the man first, and inquire particulars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reaching home, Christopher found at his door a horse and wagonette
in charge of a man-servant in livery, who repeated what Faith had told
her brother.&nbsp; Wyndway House was a well-known country-seat three
or four miles out of the town, and the coachman mentioned that if they
were going it would be well that they should get ready to start as soon
as they conveniently could, since he had been told to return by ten
if possible.&nbsp; Christopher quickly prepared himself, and put a new
string or two into Faith&rsquo;s harp, by which time she also was dressed;
and, wrapping up herself and her instrument safe from the night air,
away they drove at half-past nine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it a large party?&rsquo; said Christopher, as they whizzed
along.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir; it is what we call a dance&mdash;that is, &rsquo;tis
like a ball, you know, on a small scale&mdash;a ball on a spurt, that
you never thought of till you had it.&nbsp; In short, it grew out of
a talk at dinner, I believe; and some of the young people present wanted
a jig, and didn&rsquo;t care to play themselves, you know, young ladies
being an idle class of society at the best of times.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
a house full of sleeping company, you understand&mdash;been there a
week some of &rsquo;em&mdash;most of &rsquo;em being mistress&rsquo;s
relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They probably found it a little dull.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes&mdash;it is rather dull for &rsquo;em&mdash;Christmas-time
and all.&nbsp; As soon as it was proposed they were wild for sending
post-haste for somebody or other to play to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they name me particularly?&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; &ldquo;Mr. Christopher Julian,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The gent who&rsquo;s turned music-man?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; says she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were music-men living nearer to your end of the town
than I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but I know it was you particular: though I don&rsquo;t
think mistress thought anything about you at first.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the butler&mdash;said that your name was mentioned to our old party,
when he was in the room, by a young lady staying with us, and mistress
says then, &ldquo;The Julians have had a downfall, and the son has taken
to music.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then when dancing was talked of, they said, &ldquo;O,
let&rsquo;s have him by all means.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the young lady who first inquired for my family the same
one who said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have him by all means?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; but it was on account of her asking that the rest said
they would like you to play&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s as I had it
from Joyce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know that lady&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cold, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher did not like to question the man any further, though
what he had heard added new life to his previous curiosity; and they
drove along the way in silence, Faith&rsquo;s figure, wrapped up to
the top of her head, cutting into the sky behind them like a sugar-loaf.&nbsp;
Such gates as crossed the roads had been left open by the forethought
of the coachman, and, passing the lodge, they proceeded about half-a-mile
along a private drive, then ascended a rise, and came in view of the
front of the mansion, punctured with windows that were now mostly lighted
up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; said Faith, catching a glimpse of something
that the carriage-lamp showed on the face of one wall as they passed,
a marble bas-relief of some battle-piece, built into the stonework.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the scene of the death of one of the squire&rsquo;s
forefathers&mdash;Colonel Sir Martin Jones, who was killed at the moment
of victory in the battle of Salamanca&mdash;but I haven&rsquo;t been
here long enough to know the rights of it.&nbsp; When I am in one of
my meditations, as I wait here with the carriage sometimes, I think
how many more get killed at the moment of victory than at the moment
of defeat.&nbsp; This is the entrance for you, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he turned the corner and pulled up before a side door.</p>
<p>They alighted and went in, Christopher shouldering Faith&rsquo;s
harp, and she marching modestly behind, with curly-eared music-books
under her arm.&nbsp; They were shown into the house-steward&rsquo;s
room, and ushered thence along a badly-lit passage and past a door within
which a hum and laughter were audible.&nbsp; The door next to this was
then opened for them, and they entered.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Scarcely had Faith, or Christopher either, ever beheld a more shining
scene than was presented by the saloon in which they now found themselves.&nbsp;
Coming direct from the gloomy park, and led to the room by that back
passage from the servants&rsquo; quarter, the light from the chandelier
and branches against the walls, striking on gilding at all points, quite
dazzled their sight for a minute or two; it caused Faith to move forward
with her eyes on the floor, and filled Christopher with an impulse to
turn back again into some dusky corner where every thread of his not
over-new dress suit&mdash;rather moth-eaten through lack of feasts for
airing it&mdash;could be counted less easily.</p>
<p>He was soon seated before a grand piano, and Faith sat down under
the shadow of her harp, both being arranged on a dais within an alcove
at one end of the room.&nbsp; A screen of ivy and holly had been constructed
across the front of this recess for the games of the children on Christmas
Eve, and it still remained there, a small creep-hole being left for
entrance and exit.</p>
<p>Then the merry guests tumbled through doors at the further end, and
dancing began.&nbsp; The mingling of black-coated men and bright ladies
gave a charming appearance to the groups as seen by Faith and her brother,
the whole spectacle deriving an unexpected novelty from the accident
of reaching their eyes through interstices in the tracery of green leaves,
which added to the picture a softness that it would not otherwise have
possessed.&nbsp; On the other hand, the musicians, having a much weaker
light, could hardly be discerned by the performers in the dance.</p>
<p>The music was now rattling on, and the ladies in their foam-like
dresses were busily threading and spinning about the floor, when Faith,
casually looking up into her brother&rsquo;s face, was surprised to
see that a change had come over it.&nbsp; At the end of the quadrille
he leant across to her before she had time to speak, and said quietly,
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; said Faith, for she had not heard the words of
the coachman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ethelberta.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is she?&rsquo; asked Faith, peeping through with the
keenest interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The one who has the skirts of her dress looped up with convolvulus
flowers&mdash;the one with her hair fastened in a sort of Venus knot
behind; she has just been dancing with that perfumed piece of a man
they call Mr. Ladywell&mdash;it is he with the high eyebrows arched
like a girl&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; He added, with a wrinkled smile, &lsquo;I
cannot for my life see anybody answering to the character of husband
to her, for every man takes notice of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by another dance being called for, and then,
his fingers tapping about upon the keys as mechanically as fowls pecking
at barleycorns, Christopher gave himself up with a curious and far from
unalloyed pleasure to the occupation of watching Ethelberta, now again
crossing the field of his vision like a returned comet whose characteristics
were becoming purely historical.&nbsp; She was a plump-armed creature,
with a white round neck as firm as a fort&mdash;altogether a vigorous
shape, as refreshing to the eye as the green leaves through which he
beheld her.&nbsp; She danced freely, and with a zest that was apparently
irrespective of partners.&nbsp; He had been waiting long to hear her
speak, and when at length her voice did reach his ears, it was the revelation
of a strange matter to find how great a thing that small event had become
to him.&nbsp; He knew the old utterance&mdash;rapid but not frequent,
an obstructive thought causing sometimes a sudden halt in the midst
of a stream of words.&nbsp; But the features by which a cool observer
would have singled her out from others in his memory when asking himself
what she was like, was a peculiar gaze into imaginary far-away distance
when making a quiet remark to a partner&mdash;not with contracted eyes
like a seafaring man, but with an open full look&mdash;a remark in which
little words in a low tone were made to express a great deal, as several
single gentlemen afterwards found.</p>
<p>The production of dance-music when the criticizing stage among the
dancers has passed, and they have grown full of excitement and animal
spirits, does not require much concentration of thought in the producers
thereof; and desultory conversation accordingly went on between Faith
and her brother from time to time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kit,&rsquo; she said on one occasion, &lsquo;are you looking
at the way in which the flowers are fastened to the leaves?&mdash;taking
a mean advantage of being at the back of the tapestry?&nbsp; You cannot
think how you stare at them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was looking through them&mdash;certainly not at them.&nbsp;
I have a feeling of being moved about like a puppet in the hands of
a person who legally can be nothing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That charming woman with the shining bunch of hair and convolvuluses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: it is through her that we are brought here, and through
her writing that poem, &ldquo;Cancelled Words,&rdquo; that the book
was sent me, and through the accidental renewal of acquaintance between
us on Anglebury Heath, that she wrote the poem.&nbsp; I was, however,
at the moment you spoke, thinking more particularly of the little teacher
whom Ethelberta must have commissioned to send the book to me; and why
that girl was chosen to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There may be a hundred reasons.&nbsp; Kit, I have never yet
seen her look once this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher had certainly not yet received look or gesture from her;
but his time came.&nbsp; It was while he was for a moment outside the
recess, and he caught her in the act.&nbsp; She became slightly confused,
turned aside, and entered into conversation with a neighbour.</p>
<p>It was only a look, and yet what a look it was!&nbsp; One may say
of a look that it is capable of division into as many species, genera,
orders, and classes, as the animal world itself.&nbsp; Christopher saw
Ethelberta Petherwin&rsquo;s performance in this kind&mdash;the well-known
spark of light upon the well-known depths of mystery&mdash;and felt
something going out of him which had gone out of him once before.</p>
<p>Thus continually beholding her and her companions in the giddy whirl,
the night wore on with the musicians, last dances and more last dances
being added, till the intentions of the old on the matter were thrice
exceeded in the interests of the young.&nbsp; Watching the couples whirl
and turn, advance and recede as gently as spirits, knot themselves like
house-flies and part again, and lullabied by the faint regular beat
of their footsteps to the tune, the players sank into the peculiar mesmeric
quiet which comes over impressionable people who play for a great length
of time in the midst of such scenes; and at last the only noises that
Christopher took cognizance of were those of the exceptional kind, breaking
above the general sea of sound&mdash;a casual smart rustle of silk,
a laugh, a stumble, the monosyllabic talk of those who happened to linger
for a moment close to the leafy screen&mdash;all coming to his ears
like voices from those old times when he had mingled in similar scenes,
not as servant but as guest.</p>
<h2>5. AT THE WINDOW&mdash;THE ROAD HOME</h2>
<p>The dancing was over at last, and the radiant company had left the
room.&nbsp; A long and weary night it had been for the two players,
though a stimulated interest had hindered physical exhaustion in one
of them for a while.&nbsp; With tingling fingers and aching arms they
came out of the alcove into the long and deserted apartment, now pervaded
by a dry haze.&nbsp; The lights had burnt low, and Faith and her brother
were waiting by request till the wagonette was ready to take them home,
a breakfast being in course of preparation for them meanwhile.</p>
<p>Christopher had crossed the room to relieve his cramped limbs, and
now, peeping through a crevice in the window curtains, he said suddenly,
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s for a transformation scene?&nbsp; Faith, look here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He touched the blind, up it flew, and a gorgeous scene presented
itself to her eyes.&nbsp; A huge inflamed sun was breasting the horizon
of a wide sheet of sea which, to her surprise and delight, the mansion
overlooked.&nbsp; The brilliant disc fired all the waves that lay between
it and the shore at the bottom of the grounds, where the water tossed
the ruddy light from one undulation to another in glares as large and
clear as mirrors, incessantly altering them, destroying them, and creating
them again; while further off they multiplied, thickened, and ran into
one another like struggling armies, till they met the fiery source of
them all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, how wonderful it is!&rsquo; said Faith, putting her hand
on Christopher&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who knew that whilst we were
all shut in here with our puny illumination such an exhibition as this
was going on outside!&nbsp; How sorry and mean the grand and stately
room looks now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher turned his back upon the window, and there were the hitherto
beaming candle-flames shining no more radiantly than tarnished javelin-heads,
while the snow-white lengths of wax showed themselves clammy and cadaverous
as the fingers of a corpse.&nbsp; The leaves and flowers which had appeared
so very green and blooming by the artificial light were now seen to
be faded and dusty.&nbsp; Only the gilding of the room in some degree
brought itself into keeping with the splendours outside, stray darts
of light seizing upon it and lengthening themselves out along fillet,
quirk, arris, and moulding, till wasted away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems,&rsquo; said Faith, &lsquo;as if all the people who
were lately so merry here had died: we ourselves look no more than ghosts.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She turned up her weary face to her brother&rsquo;s, which the incoming
rays smote aslant, making little furrows of every wrinkle thereon, and
shady ravines of every little furrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very tired, Faith,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such
a heavy night&rsquo;s work has been almost too much for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rsquo; said Faith.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I could not have played so long by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We filled up one another&rsquo;s gaps; and there were plenty
of them towards the morning; but, luckily, people don&rsquo;t notice
those things when the small hours draw on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What troubles me most,&rsquo; said Faith, &lsquo;is not that
I have worked, but that you should be so situated as to need such miserable
assistance as mine.&nbsp; We are poor, are we not, Kit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we know a little about poverty,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>While thus lingering</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In shadowy thoroughfares of thought,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faith interrupted with, &lsquo;I believe there is one of the dancers
now!&mdash;why, I should have thought they had all gone to bed, and
wouldn&rsquo;t get up again for days.&rsquo;&nbsp; She indicated to
him a figure on the lawn towards the left, looking upon the same flashing
scene as that they themselves beheld.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your own particular one,&rsquo; continued Faith.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, I see the blue flowers under the edge of her cloak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I see her squirrel-coloured hair,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>Both stood looking at this apparition, who once, and only once, thought
fit to turn her head towards the front of the house they were gazing
from.&nbsp; Faith was one in whom the meditative somewhat overpowered
the active faculties; she went on, with no abundance of love, to theorize
upon this gratuitously charming woman, who, striking freakishly into
her brother&rsquo;s path, seemed likely to do him no good in her sisterly
estimation.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s bright and shapely form stood before
her critic now, smartened by the motes of sunlight from head to heel:
what Faith would have given to see her so clearly within!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without doubt she is already a lady of many romantic experiences,&rsquo;
she said dubiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And on the way to many more,&rsquo; said Christopher.&nbsp;
The tone was just of the kind which may be imagined of a sombre man
who had been up all night piping that others might dance.</p>
<p>Faith parted her lips as if in consternation at possibilities.&nbsp;
Ethelberta, having already become an influence in Christopher&rsquo;s
system, might soon become more&mdash;an indestructible fascination&mdash;to
drag him about, turn his soul inside out, harrow him, twist him, and
otherwise torment him, according to the stereotyped form of such processes.</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the opening of a door.&nbsp; A servant entered
and came up to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is for you, I believe, sir,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two
guineas;&rsquo; and he placed the money in Christopher&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some breakfast will be ready for you in a moment if you like
to have it.&nbsp; Would you wish it brought in here; or will you come
to the steward&rsquo;s room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we will come.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the man then began to
extinguish the lights one by one.&nbsp; Christopher dropped the two
pounds and two shillings singly into his pocket, and looking listlessly
at the footman said, &lsquo;Can you tell me the address of that lady
on the lawn?&nbsp; Ah, she has disappeared!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wore a dress with blue flowers,&rsquo; said Faith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And remarkable bright in her manner?&nbsp; O, that&rsquo;s
the young widow, Mrs&mdash;what&rsquo;s that name&mdash;I forget for
the moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Widow?&rsquo; said Christopher, the eyes of his understanding
getting wonderfully clear, and Faith uttering a private ejaculation
of thanks that after all no commandments were likely to be broken in
this matter.&nbsp; &lsquo;The lady I mean is quite a girlish sort of
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, so she is&mdash;that&rsquo;s the one.&nbsp; Coachman
says she must have been born a widow, for there is not time for her
ever to have been made one.&nbsp; However, she&rsquo;s not quite such
a chicken as all that.&nbsp; Mrs. Petherwin, that&rsquo;s the party&rsquo;s
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she live here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she is staying in the house visiting for a few days with
her mother-in-law.&nbsp; They are a London family, I don&rsquo;t know
her address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she a poetess?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I cannot say.&nbsp; She is very clever at verses; but
she don&rsquo;t lean over gates to see the sun, and goes to church as
regular as you or I, so I should hardly be inclined to say that she&rsquo;s
the complete thing.&nbsp; When she&rsquo;s up in one of her vagaries
she&rsquo;ll sit with the ladies and make up pretty things out of her
head as fast as sticks a-breaking.&nbsp; They will run off her tongue
like cotton from a reel, and if she can ever be got in the mind of telling
a story she will bring it out that serious and awful that it makes your
flesh creep upon your bones; if she&rsquo;s only got to say that she
walked out of one door into another, she&rsquo;ll tell it so that there
seems something wonderful in it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a bother to start
her, so our people say behind her back, but, once set going, the house
is all alive with her.&nbsp; However, it will soon be dull enough; she
and Lady Petherwin are off to-morrow for Rookington, where I believe
they are going to stay over New Year&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where do you say they are going?&rsquo; inquired Christopher,
as they followed the footman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rookington Park&mdash;about three miles out of Sandbourne,
in the opposite direction to this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A widow,&rsquo; Christopher murmured.</p>
<p>Faith overheard him.&nbsp; &lsquo;That makes no difference to us,
does it?&rsquo; she said wistfully.</p>
<p>Forty minutes later they were driving along an open road over a ridge
which commanded a view of a small inlet below them, the sands of this
nook being sheltered by crumbling cliffs.&nbsp; Here at once they saw,
in the full light of the sun, two women standing side by side, their
faces directed over the sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There she is again!&rsquo; said Faith.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has
walked along the shore from the lawn where we saw her before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the coachman, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a curious
woman seemingly.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll talk to any poor body she meets.&nbsp;
You see she had been out for a morning walk instead of going to bed,
and that is some queer mortal or other she has picked up with on her
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder she does not prefer some rest,&rsquo; Faith observed.</p>
<p>The road then dropped into a hollow, and the women by the sea were
no longer within view from the carriage, which rapidly neared Sandbourne
with the two musicians.</p>
<h2>6. THE SHORE BY WYNDWAY</h2>
<p>The east gleamed upon Ethelberta&rsquo;s squirrel-coloured hair as
she said to her companion, &lsquo;I have come, Picotee; but not, as
you imagine, from a night&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; We have actually been
dancing till daylight at Wyndway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you should not have troubled to come!&nbsp; I could have
borne the disappointment under such circumstances,&rsquo; said the pupil-teacher,
who, wearing a dress not so familiar to Christopher&rsquo;s eyes as
had been the little white jacket, had not been recognized by him from
the hill.&nbsp; &lsquo;You look so tired, Berta.&nbsp; I could not stay
up all night for the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One gets used to these things,&rsquo; said Ethelberta quietly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should have been in bed certainly, had I not particularly wished
to use this opportunity of meeting you before you go home to-morrow.&nbsp;
I could not have come to Sandbourne to-day, because we are leaving to
return again to Rookington.&nbsp; This is all that I wish you to take
to mother&mdash;only a few little things which may be useful to her;
but you will see what it contains when you open it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
handed to Picotee a small parcel.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is for yourself,&rsquo;
she went on, giving a small packet besides.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will pay
your fare home and back, and leave you something to spare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Picotee docilely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Picotee,&rsquo; continued the elder, &lsquo;let us talk
for a few minutes before I go back: we may not meet again for some time.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She put her arm round the waist of Picotee, who did the same by Ethelberta;
and thus interlaced they walked backwards and forwards upon the firm
flat sand with the motion of one body animated by one will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what did you think of my poems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I liked them; but naturally, I did not understand all the
experience you describe.&nbsp; It is so different from mine.&nbsp; Yet
that made them more interesting to me.&nbsp; I thought I should so much
like to mix in the same scenes; but that of course is impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid it is.&nbsp; And you posted the book as I said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; She added hurriedly, as if to change the
subject, &lsquo;I have told nobody that we are sisters, or that you
are known in any way to me or to mother or to any of us.&nbsp; I thought
that would be best, from what you said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, perhaps it is best for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The box of clothes came safely, and I find very little alteration
will be necessary to make the dress do beautifully for me on Sundays.&nbsp;
It is quite new-fashioned to me, though I suppose it was old-fashioned
to you.&nbsp; O, and Berta, will the title of Lady Petherwin descend
to you when your mother-in-law dies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, of course not.&nbsp; She is only a knight&rsquo;s widow,
and that&rsquo;s nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady of a knight looks as good on paper as the lady of
a lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And in other places too sometimes.&nbsp; However,
about your journey home.&nbsp; Be very careful; and don&rsquo;t make
any inquiries at the stations of anybody but officials.&nbsp; If any
man wants to be friendly with you, try to find out if it is from a genuine
wish to assist you, or from admiration of your fresh face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shall I know which?&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>Ethelberta laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Heaven does not tell you at the
moment I cannot,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But humanity looks with
a different eye from love, and upon the whole it is most to be prized
by all of us.&nbsp; I believe it ends oftener in marriage than do a
lover&rsquo;s flying smiles.&nbsp; So that for this and other reasons
love from a stranger is mostly worthless as a speculation; and it is
certainly dangerous as a game.&nbsp; Well, Picotee, has any one paid
you real attentions yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;that is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a wee bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so.&nbsp; There was a dishonesty about your dear
eyes which has never been there before, and love-making and dishonesty
are inseparable as coupled hounds.&nbsp; Up comes man, and away goes
innocence.&nbsp; Are you going to tell me anything about him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather not, Ethelberta; because it is hardly anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, be careful.&nbsp; And mind this, never tell him what
you feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But then he will never know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor must he.&nbsp; He must think it only.&nbsp; The difference
between his thinking and knowing is often the difference between your
winning and losing.&nbsp; But general advice is not of much use, and
I cannot give more unless you tell more.&nbsp; What is his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee did not reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind: keep your secret.&nbsp; However, listen to this:
not a kiss&mdash;not so much as the shadow, hint, or merest seedling
of a kiss!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no fear of it,&rsquo; murmured Picotee; &lsquo;though
not because of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, my dear Picotee, a lover is not a relative; and he
isn&rsquo;t quite a stranger; but he may end in being either, and the
way to reduce him to whichever of the two you wish him to be is to treat
him like the other.&nbsp; Men who come courting are just like bad cooks:
if you are kind to them, instead of ascribing it to an exceptional courtesy
on your part, they instantly set it down to their own marvellous worth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I ought to favour him just a little, poor thing?&nbsp;
Just the smallest glimmer of a gleam!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a very little indeed&mdash;so that it comes as a relief
to his misery, not as adding to his happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is being too clever, all this; and we ought to be harmless
as doves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Picotee! to continue harmless as a dove you must be wise
as a serpent, you&rsquo;ll find&mdash;ay, ten serpents, for that matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if I cannot get at him, how can I manage him in these
ways you speak of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get at him?&nbsp; I suppose he gets at you in some way, does
he not?&mdash;tries to see you, or to be near you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;that&rsquo;s just the point&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t
do any such thing, and there&rsquo;s the worry of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what a silly girl!&nbsp; Then he is not your lover at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; But I am his, at any rate&mdash;twice
over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; Supply the love for both sides?&nbsp;
Why, it&rsquo;s worse than furnishing money for both.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
suppose a man will give his heart in exchange for a woman&rsquo;s when
he has already got hers for nothing?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the way
old Adam does business at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you got a young man, too, Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A young man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lover I mean&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we call &rsquo;em down
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is difficult to explain,&rsquo; said Ethelberta evasively.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I knew one many years ago, and I have seen him again, and&mdash;that
is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;According to my idea you have one, but according to your own
you have not; he does not love you, but you love him&mdash;is that how
it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not quite considered how it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you love him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never seen a man I hate less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A great deal lies covered up there, I expect!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was in that carriage which drove over the hill at the moment
we met here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah-ah&mdash;some great lord or another who has his day by
candlelight, and so on.&nbsp; I guess the style.&nbsp; Somebody who
no more knows how much bread is a loaf than I do the price of diamonds
and pearls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid he&rsquo;s only a commoner as yet, and not a very
great one either.&nbsp; But surely you guess, Picotee?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
set you an example of frankness by telling his name.&nbsp; My friend,
Mr. Julian, to whom you posted the book.&nbsp; Such changes as he has
seen!&mdash;from affluence to poverty.&nbsp; He and his sister have
been playing dances all night at Wyndway&mdash;What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a pain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Picotee&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll sit down for a moment, Berta.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;have you over-walked yourself, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;and I got up very early, you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you are not going to be ill, child.&nbsp; You look
as if you ought not to be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is quite trifling.&nbsp; Does not getting up in a hurry
cause a sense of faintness sometimes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, in people who are not strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we don&rsquo;t talk about being faint it will go off.&nbsp;
Faintness is such a queer thing that to think of it is to have it.&nbsp;
Let us talk as we were talking before&mdash;about your young man and
other indifferent matters, so as to divert my thoughts from fainting,
dear Berta.&nbsp; I have always thought the book was to be forwarded
to that gentleman because he was a connection of yours by marriage,
and he had asked for it.&nbsp; And so you have met this&mdash;this Mr.
Julian, and gone for walks with him in evenings, I suppose, just as
young men and women do who are courting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed&mdash;what an absurd child you are!&rsquo; said
Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew him once, and he is interesting; a few
little things like that make it all up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The love is all on one side, as with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no: there is nothing like that.&nbsp; I am not attached
to any one, strictly speaking&mdash;though, more strictly speaking,
I am not unattached.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a delightful middle mind to be in.&nbsp; I know
it, for I was like it once; but I had scarcely been so long enough to
know where I was before I was gone past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have commanded yourself, or drawn back entirely;
for let me tell you that at the beginning of caring for a man&mdash;just
when you are suspended between thinking and feeling&mdash;there is a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth of time at which the question of getting into love
or not getting in is a matter of will&mdash;quite a thing of choice.&nbsp;
At the same time, drawing back is a tame dance, and the best of all
is to stay balanced awhile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do that well, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no; for what between continually wanting to love, to
escape the blank lives of those who do not, and wanting not to love,
to keep out of the miseries of those who do, I get foolishly warm and
foolishly cold by turns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;and I am like you as far as the &ldquo;foolishly&rdquo;
goes.&nbsp; I wish we poor girls could contrive to bring a little wisdom
into our love by way of a change!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing that leading minds in town have
begun to do, but there are difficulties.&nbsp; It is easy to love wisely,
but the rich man may not marry you; and it is not very hard to reject
wisely, but the poor man doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Altogether it is
a precious problem.&nbsp; But shall we clamber out upon those shining
blocks of rock, and find some of the little yellow shells that are in
the crevices?&nbsp; I have ten minutes longer, and then I must go.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>7. THE DINING-ROOM OF A TOWN HOUSE&mdash;THE BUTLER&rsquo;S PANTRY</h2>
<p>A few weeks later there was a friendly dinner-party at the house
of a gentleman called Doncastle, who lived in a moderately fashionable
square of west London.&nbsp; All the friends and relatives present were
nice people, who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at
being there; but as regards the vigour with which these emotions were
expressed, it may be stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat
and a slight narrowing of the eye were equivalent as indices of the
degree of mirth felt to a Ha-ha-ha! and a shaking of the shoulders among
the minor traders of the kingdom; and to a Ho-ho-ho! contorted features,
purple face, and stamping foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian
who adorn the remoter provinces.</p>
<p>The conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical, tender, and
humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse,
which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere.&nbsp; This topic,
beginning as a private dialogue between a young painter named Ladywell
and the lady on his right hand, had enlarged its ground by degrees,
as a subject will extend on those rare occasions when it happens to
be one about which each person has thought something beforehand, instead
of, as in the natural order of things, one to which the oblivious listener
replies mechanically, with earnest features, but with thoughts far away.&nbsp;
And so the whole table made the matter a thing to inquire or reply upon
at once, and isolated rills of other chat died out like a river in the
sands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Witty things, and occasionally Anacreontic: and they have
the originality which such a style must naturally possess when carried
out by a feminine hand,&rsquo; said Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is a feminine hand,&rsquo; said a man near.</p>
<p>Ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets, though he did not
wish to boast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Written, I presume you mean, in the Anacreontic measure of
three feet and a half&mdash;spondees and iambics?&rsquo; said a gentleman
in spectacles, glancing round, and giving emphasis to his inquiry by
causing bland glares of a circular shape to proceed from his glasses
towards the person interrogated.</p>
<p>The company appeared willing to give consideration to the words of
a man who knew such things as that, and hung forward to listen.&nbsp;
But Ladywell stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction
by saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; I was speaking rather of the matter and tone.&nbsp;
In fact, the <i>Seven Days&rsquo; Review</i> said they were Anacreontic,
you know; and so they are&mdash;any one may feel they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The general look then implied a false encouragement, and the man
in spectacles looked down again, being a nervous person, who never had
time to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his
faults.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know the authoress, Mr. Neigh?&rsquo; continued Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I do,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Neigh was a man who never disturbed the flesh upon his face except
when he was obliged to do so, and paused ten seconds where other people
only paused one; as he moved his chin in speaking, motes of light from
under the candle-shade caught, lost, and caught again the outlying threads
of his burnished beard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will be famous some day; and you ought at any rate to
read her book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I ought, I know.&nbsp; In fact, some years ago I should
have done it immediately, because I had a reason for pushing on that
way just then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, what was that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I thought of going in for Westminster Abbey myself at
that time; but a fellow has so much to do, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a pity that you didn&rsquo;t follow it up.&nbsp; A man
of your powers, Mr. Neigh&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afterwards I found I was too steady for it, and had too much
of the respectable householder in me.&nbsp; Besides, so many other men
are on the same tack; and then I didn&rsquo;t care about it, somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand high art, and am utterly in the dark
on what are the true laws of criticism,&rsquo; a plain married lady,
who wore archaeological jewellery, was saying at this time.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I know that I have derived an unusual amount of amusement from those
verses, and I am heartily thankful to &ldquo;E.&rdquo; for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said a gentleman who was suffering from
a bad shirt-front, &lsquo;that an estimate which depends upon feeling
in that way is not to be trusted as permanent opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The subject now flitted to the other end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somebody has it that when the heart flies out before the understanding,
it saves the judgment a world of pains,&rsquo; came from a voice in
that quarter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, for my part, like something merry,&rsquo; said an elderly
woman, whose face was bisected by the edge of a shadow, which toned
her forehead and eyelids to a livid neutral tint, and left her cheeks
and mouth like metal at a white heat in the uninterrupted light.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think the liveliness of those ballads as great a recommendation
as any.&nbsp; After all, enough misery is known to us by our experiences
and those of our friends, and what we see in the newspapers, for all
purposes of chastening, without having gratuitous grief inflicted upon
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you would not have wished that &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;
should have ended happily, or that Othello should have discovered the
perfidy of his Ancient in time to prevent all fatal consequences?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not afraid to go so far as that,&rsquo; said the old
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shakespeare is not everybody, and I am sure that
thousands of people who have seen those plays would have driven home
more cheerfully afterwards if by some contrivance the characters could
all have been joined together respectively.&nbsp; I uphold our anonymous
author on the general ground of her levity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is an old and worn argument&mdash;that about the
inexpedience of tragedy&mdash;and much may be said on both sides.&nbsp;
It is not to be denied that the anonymous Sappho&rsquo;s verses&mdash;for
it seems that she is really a woman&mdash;are clever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clever!&rsquo; said Ladywell&mdash;the young man who had been
one of the shooting-party at Sandbourne&mdash;&lsquo;they are marvellously
brilliant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is rather warm in her assumed character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a sign of her actual coldness; she lets off her
feeling in theoretic grooves, and there is sure to be none left for
practical ones.&nbsp; Whatever seems to be the most prominent vice,
or the most prominent virtue in anybody&rsquo;s writing is the one thing
you are safest from in personal dealings with the writer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mean to call her warmth of feeling a vice
or virtue exactly&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agree with you,&rsquo; said Neigh to the last speaker but
one, in tones as emphatic as they possibly could be without losing their
proper character of indifference to the whole matter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Warm
sentiment of any sort, whenever we have it, disturbs us too much to
leave us repose enough for writing it down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, when I was at the ardent age,&rsquo; said the mistress
of the house, in a tone of pleasantly agreeing with every one, particularly
those who were diametrically opposed to each other, &lsquo;I could no
more have printed such emotions and made them public than I&mdash;could
have helped privately feeling them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if she has gone through half she says?&nbsp; If so,
what an experience!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;not at all likely,&rsquo; said Mr. Neigh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is as risky to calculate people&rsquo;s ways of living from
their writings as their incomes from their way of living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is as true to nature as fashion is false,&rsquo; said
the painter, in his warmth becoming scarcely complimentary, as sometimes
happens with young persons.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that she
has written a word more than what every woman would deny feeling in
a society where no woman says what she means or does what she says.&nbsp;
And can any praise be greater than that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha!&nbsp; Capital!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All her verses seem to me,&rsquo; said a rather stupid person,
&lsquo;to be simply&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tral&rsquo;-la-la-lal&rsquo;-la-la-la&rsquo;,<br />
Tral&rsquo;-la-la-lal&rsquo;-la-la-lu&rsquo;,<br />
Tral&rsquo;-la-la-lal&rsquo;-la-la-lalla&rsquo;,<br />
Tral&rsquo;-la-la-lu&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you take away the music there is nothing left.&nbsp; Yet she
is plainly a woman of great culture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you seen what the <i>London Light</i> says about them&mdash;one
of the finest things I have ever read in the way of admiration?&rsquo;
continued Ladywell, paying no attention to the previous speaker.&nbsp;
He lingered for a reply, and then impulsively quoted several lines from
the periodical he had named, without aid or hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good,
is it not?&rsquo; added Ladywell.</p>
<p>They assented, but in such an unqualified manner that half as much
readiness would have meant more.&nbsp; But Ladywell, though not experienced
enough to be quite free from enthusiasm, was too experienced to mind
indifference for more than a minute or two.&nbsp; When the ladies had
withdrawn, the young man went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Colonel Staff said a funny thing to me yesterday about these
very poems.&nbsp; He asked me if I knew her, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her?&nbsp; Why, he knows that it is a lady all the time, and
we were only just now doubting whether the sex of the writer could be
really what it seems.&nbsp; Shame, Ladywell!&rsquo; said his friend
Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Mr. Ladywell,&rsquo; said another, &lsquo;now we have
found you out.&nbsp; You know her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now&mdash;I say&mdash;ha-ha!&rsquo; continued the painter,
with a face expressing that he had not at all tried to be found out
as the man possessing incomparably superior knowledge of the poetess.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I beg pardon really, but don&rsquo;t press me on the matter.&nbsp;
Upon my word the secret is not my own.&nbsp; As I was saying, the Colonel
said, &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t care
to hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall be delighted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So the Colonel said, &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; adding,
in a most comic way, &ldquo;Between U. and E., Ladywell, I believe there
is a close affinity&rdquo;&mdash;meaning me, you know, by U.&nbsp; Just
like the Colonel&mdash;ha-ha-ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The older men did not oblige Ladywell a second time with any attempt
at appreciation; but a weird silence ensued, during which the smile
upon Ladywell&rsquo;s face became frozen to painful permanence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meaning by E., you know, the &ldquo;E&rdquo; of the poems&mdash;heh-heh!&rsquo;
he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a very humorous incident certainly,&rsquo; said his
friend Neigh, at which there was a laugh&mdash;not from anything connected
with what he said, but simply because it was the right thing to laugh
when Neigh meant you to do so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t, Neigh&mdash;you are too hard upon me.&nbsp;
But, seriously, two or three fellows were there when I said it, and
they all began laughing&mdash;but, then, the Colonel said it in such
a queer way, you know.&nbsp; But you were asking me about her?&nbsp;
Well, the fact is, between ourselves, I do know that she is a lady;
and I don&rsquo;t mind telling a word&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we would not for the world be the means of making you
betray her confidence&mdash;would we, Jones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed; we would not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; it is not that at all&mdash;this is really too bad!&mdash;you
must listen just for a moment&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladywell, don&rsquo;t betray anybody on our account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whoever the illustrious young lady may be she has seen a great
deal of the world,&rsquo; said Mr. Doncastle blandly, &lsquo;and puts
her experience of the comedy of its emotions, and of its method of showing
them, in a very vivid light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard a man say that the novelty with which the ideas are
presented is more noticeable than the originality of the ideas themselves,&rsquo;
observed Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;The woman has made a great talk about herself;
and I am quite weary of people asking of her condition, place of abode,
has she a father, has she a mother, or dearer one yet than all other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would have burlesque quotation put down by Act of Parliament,
and all who dabble in it placed with him who can cite Scripture for
his purposes,&rsquo; said Ladywell, in retaliation.</p>
<p>After a pause Neigh remarked half-privately to their host, who was
his uncle: &lsquo;Your butler Chickerel is a very intelligent man, as
I have heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he does very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Doncastle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is he not a&mdash;very extraordinary man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to my knowledge,&rsquo; said Doncastle, looking up surprised.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why do you think that, Alfred?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps it was not a matter to mention.&nbsp; He reads
a great deal, I dare say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I noticed how wonderfully his face kindled when we began talking
about the poems during dinner.&nbsp; Perhaps he is a poet himself in
disguise.&nbsp; Did you observe it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; To the best of my belief he is a very trustworthy
and honourable man.&nbsp; He has been with us&mdash;let me see, how
long?&mdash;five months, I think, and he was fifteen years in his last
place.&nbsp; It certainly is a new side to his character if he publicly
showed any interest in the conversation, whatever he might have felt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since the matter has been mentioned,&rsquo; said Mr. Jones,
&lsquo;I may say that I too noticed the singularity of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had not said otherwise,&rsquo; replied Doncastle somewhat
warmly, &lsquo;I should have asserted him to be the last man-servant
in London to infringe such an elementary rule.&nbsp; If he did so this
evening, it is certainly for the first time, and I sincerely hope that
no annoyance was caused&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;it might have been a mistake
of mine,&rsquo; said Jones.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should quite have forgotten
the circumstance if Mr. Neigh&rsquo;s words had not brought it to my
mind.&nbsp; It was really nothing to notice, and I beg that you will
not say a word to him about it on my account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has a taste that way, my dear uncle, nothing more, depend
upon it,&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had such a man belonging
to me I should only be too proud.&nbsp; Certainly do not mention it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course Chickerel is Chickerel,&rsquo; Mr. Doncastle rejoined.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We all know what that means.&nbsp; And really, on reflecting,
I do remember that he is of a literary turn of mind&mdash;not further
by an inch than is commendable, you know.&nbsp; I am quite aware as
I glance down the papers and prints any morning that Chickerel&rsquo;s
eyes have been over the ground before mine, and that he generally forestalls
the rest of us by a chapter or so in the last new book sent home; but
in these vicious days that particular weakness is really virtue, just
because it is not quite a vice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Jones, the reflective man in spectacles,
&lsquo;positive virtues are getting moved off the stage: negative ones
are moved on to the place of positives; we thank bare justice as we
used only to thank generosity; call a man honest who steals only by
law, and consider him a benefactor if he does not steal at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will decide
that Chickerel is even a better trained fellow than if he had shown
no interest at all in his face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The action being like those trifling irregularities in art
at its vigorous periods, which seemed designed to hide the unpleasant
monotony of absolute symmetry,&rsquo; said Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the other hand, an affected want of training of that sort
would be even a better disguise for an artful man than a perfectly impassible
demeanour.&nbsp; He is two removes from discovery in a hidden scheme,
whilst a neutral face is only one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You quite alarm me by these subtle theories,&rsquo; said Mr.
Doncastle, laughing; and the subject then became compounded with other
matters, till the speakers rose to rejoin the charming flock upstairs.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In the basement story at this hour Mr. Chickerel the butler, who
had formed the subject of discussion on the floor above, was busily
engaged in looking after his two subordinates as they bustled about
in the operations of clearing away.&nbsp; He was a man of whom, if the
shape of certain bones and muscles of the face is ever to be taken as
a guide to the character, one might safely have predicated conscientiousness
in the performance of duties, a thorough knowledge of all that appertained
to them, a general desire to live on without troubling his mind about
anything which did not concern him.&nbsp; Any person interested in the
matter would have assumed without hesitation that the estimate his employer
had given of Chickerel was a true one&mdash;more, that not only would
the butler under all ordinary circumstances resolutely prevent his face
from showing curiosity in an unbecoming way, but that, with the soul
of a true gentleman, he would, if necessary, equivocate as readily as
the noblest of his betters to remove any stain upon his honour in such
trifles.&nbsp; Hence it is apparent that if Chickerel&rsquo;s countenance
really appeared, as Neigh had asserted, full of curiosity with regard
to the gossip that was going on, the feelings which led to the exhibition
must have been of a very unusual and irrepressible kind.</p>
<p>His hair was of that peculiar bluish-white which is to be observed
when the oncoming years, instead of singling out special locks of a
man&rsquo;s head for operating against, advance uniformly over the whole
field, and enfeeble the colour at all points before absolutely extinguishing
it anywhere; his nose was of the knotty shape in the gristle and earthward
tendency in the flesh which is commonly said to carry sound judgment
above it, his eyes were thoughtful, and his face was thin&mdash;a contour
which, if it at once abstracted from his features that cheerful assurance
of single-minded honesty which adorns the exteriors of so many of his
brethren, might have raised a presumption in the minds of some beholders
that perhaps in this case the quality might not be altogether wanting
within.</p>
<p>The coffee having been served to the people upstairs, one of the
footmen rushed into his bedroom on the lower floor, and in a few minutes
emerged again in the dress of a respectable clerk who had been born
for better things, with the trifling exceptions that he wore a low-crowned
hat, and instead of knocking his heels on the pavement walked with a
gait as delicate as a lady&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Going out of the area-door
with a cigar in his mouth, he mounted the steps hastily to keep an appointment
round the corner&mdash;the keeping of which as a private gentleman necessitated
the change of the greater part of his clothes twice within a quarter
of an hour&mdash;the limit of his time of absence.&nbsp; The other footman
was upstairs, and the butler, finding that he had a few minutes to himself,
sat down at the table and wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,&mdash;I did not intend to
write to you for some few days to come, but the way in which you have
been talked about here this evening makes me anxious to send a line
or two at once, though I have very little time to spare, as usual.&nbsp;
We have just had a dinner-party&mdash;indeed the carriages have not
yet been brought round&mdash;and the talk at dinner was about your verses,
of course.&nbsp; The thing was brought up by a young fellow named Ladywell&mdash;do
you know him?&nbsp; He is a painter by profession, but he has a pretty
good private income beyond what he gets by practising his line of business
among the nobility, and that I expect is not little, for he is well
known, and encouraged because he is young, and good-looking, and so
forth.&nbsp; His family own a good bit of land somewhere out Aldbrickham
way.&nbsp; However, I am before my story.&nbsp; From what they all said
it is pretty clear that you are thought a great deal of in fashionable
society as a poetess&mdash;but perhaps you know this as well as I&mdash;moving
in it as you do yourself, my dear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ladies afterwards got very curious about your age, so
curious, in fact, and so full of certainty that you were thirty-five
and a blighted existence, if an hour, that I felt inclined to rap out
there and then, and hang what came of it: &ldquo;My daughter, ladies,
was to my own and her mother&rsquo;s certain knowledge only twenty-one
last birthday, and has as bright a heart as anybody in London.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One of them actually said that you must be fifty to have got such an
experience.&nbsp; Her guess was a very shrewd one in the bottom of it,
however, for it was grounded upon the way you use those strange experiences
of mine in the society that I tell you of, and dress them up as if they
were yours; and, as you see, she hit off my own age to a year.&nbsp;
I thought it was very sharp of her to be so right, although so wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not want to influence your plans in any way about things
which your school learning fits you to understand much better than I,
who never had such opportunities, but I think that if I were in your
place, Berta, I would not let my name be known just yet, for people
always want what&rsquo;s kept from them, and don&rsquo;t value what&rsquo;s
given.&nbsp; I am not sure, but I think that after the women had gone
upstairs the others turned their thoughts upon you again; what they
said about you I don&rsquo;t know, for if there&rsquo;s one thing I
hate &rsquo;tis hanging about the doors when the men begin to get moved
by their wine, which they did to a large extent to-night, and spoke
very loud.&nbsp; They always do here, for old Don is a hearty giver
in his way.&nbsp; However, as you see these people from their own level
now, it is not much that I can tell you in seeing them only from the
under side, though I see strange things sometimes, and of course&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What great ones do the less will prattle
of,&rdquo;</p>
<p>as it says in that book of select pieces that you gave me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear girl, I hope you will prosper.&nbsp; One thing
above all others you&rsquo;ll have to mind, and it is that folk must
continually strain to advance in order to remain where they are: and
you particularly.&nbsp; But as for trying too hard, I wouldn&rsquo;t
do it.&nbsp; Much lies in minding this, that your best plan for lightness
of heart is to raise yourself a little higher than your old mates, but
not so high as to be quite out of their reach.&nbsp; All human beings
enjoy themselves from the outside, and so getting on a little has this
good in it, you still keep in your old class where your feelings are,
and are thoughtfully treated by this class: while by getting on too
much you are sneered at by your new acquaintance, who don&rsquo;t know
the skill of your rise, and you are parted from and forgot by the old
ones who do.&nbsp; Whatever happens, don&rsquo;t be too quick to feel.&nbsp;
You will surely get some hard blows when you are found out, for if the
great can find no excuse for hitting with a mind, they&rsquo;ll do it
and say &rsquo;twas in fun.&nbsp; But you are young and healthy, and
youth and health are power.&nbsp; I wish I could have a decent footman
here with me, but I suppose it is no use trying.&nbsp; It is such men
as these that provoke the contempt we get.&nbsp; Well, thank God a few
years will see the end of me, for I am growing ashamed of my company&mdash;so
different as they are to the servants of old times.&mdash;Your affectionate
father,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
R. CHICKEREL.</p>
<p>&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;Do not press Lady Petherwin any further to remove
the rules on which you live with her.&nbsp; She is quite right: she
cannot keep us, and to recognize us would do you no good, nor us either.&nbsp;
We are content to see you secretly, since it is best for you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8. CHRISTOPHER&rsquo;S LODGINGS&mdash;THE GROUNDS ABOUT ROOKINGTON</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in the distant town of Sandbourne, Christopher Julian
had recovered from the weariness produced by his labours at the Wyndway
evening-party where Ethelberta had been a star.&nbsp; Instead of engaging
his energies to clear encumbrances from the tangled way of his life,
he now set about reading the popular &lsquo;Metres by E.&rsquo; with
more interest and assiduity than ever; for though Julian was a thinker
by instinct, he was a worker by effort only; and the higher of these
kinds being dependent upon the lower for its exhibition, there was often
a lamentable lack of evidence of his power in either.&nbsp; It is a
provoking correlation, and has conduced to the obscurity of many a genius.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kit,&rsquo; said his sister, on reviving at the end of the
bad headache which had followed the dance, &lsquo;those poems seem to
have increased in value with you.&nbsp; The lady, lofty as she appears
to be, would be flattered if she only could know how much you study
them.&nbsp; Have you decided to thank her for them?&nbsp; Now let us
talk it over&mdash;I like having a chat about such a pretty new subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would thank her in a moment if I were absolutely certain
that she had anything to do with sending them, or even writing them.&nbsp;
I am not quite sure of that yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange that a woman could bring herself to write those
verses!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all strange&mdash;they are natural outpourings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith looked critically at the remoter caverns of the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why strange?&rsquo; continued Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
is no harm in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;no harm.&nbsp; But I cannot explain to you&mdash;unless
you see it partly of your own accord&mdash;that to write them she must
be rather a fast lady&mdash;not a bad fast lady; a nice fast lady, I
mean, of course.&nbsp; There, I have said it now, and I daresay you
are vexed with me, for your interest in her has deepened to what it
originally was, I think.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean any absolute harm
by &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; Kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bold, forward, you mean, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith tried to hit upon a better definition which should meet all
views; and, on failing to do so, looked concerned at her brother&rsquo;s
somewhat grieved appearance, and said, helplessly, &lsquo;Yes, I suppose
I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My idea of her is quite the reverse.&nbsp; A poetess must
intrinsically be sensitive, or she could never feel: but then, frankness
is a rhetorical necessity even with the most modest, if their inspirations
are to do any good in the world.&nbsp; You will, for certain, not be
interested in something I was going to tell you, which I thought would
have pleased you immensely; but it is not worth mentioning now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will not tell me, never mind.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
be crabbed, Kit!&nbsp; You know how interested I am in all your affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only that I have composed an air to one of the prettiest
of her songs, &ldquo;When tapers tall&rdquo;&mdash;but I am not sure
about the power of it.&nbsp; This is how it begins&mdash;I threw it
off in a few minutes, after you had gone to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went to the piano and lightly touched over an air, the manuscript
copy of which he placed in front of him, and listened to hear her opinion,
having proved its value frequently; for it was not that of a woman merely,
but impersonally human.&nbsp; Though she was unknown to fame, this was
a great gift in Faith, since to have an unsexed judgment is as precious
as to be an unsexed being is deplorable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very fair indeed,&rsquo; said the sister, scarcely moving
her lips in her great attention.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now again, and again,
and again.&nbsp; How could you do it in the time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kit knew that she admired his performance: passive assent was her
usual praise, and she seldom insisted vigorously upon any view of his
compositions unless for purposes of emendation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking that, as I cannot very well write to her, I
may as well send her this,&rsquo; said Christopher, with lightened spirits,
voice to correspond, and eyes likewise; &lsquo;there can be no objection
to it, for such things are done continually.&nbsp; Consider while I
am gone, Faith.&nbsp; I shall be out this evening for an hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Christopher left the house shortly after, instead of going into
the town on some errand, as was customary whenever he went from home
after dark, he ascended a back street, passed over the hills behind,
and walked at a brisk pace inland along the road to Rookington Park,
where, as he had learnt, Ethelberta and Lady Petherwin were staying
for a time, the day or two which they spent at Wyndway having formed
a short break in the middle of this visit.&nbsp; The moon was shining
to-night, and Christopher sped onwards over the pallid high-road as
readily as he could have done at noonday.&nbsp; In three-quarters of
an hour he reached the park gates; and entering now upon a tract which
he had never before explored, he went along more cautiously and with
some uncertainty as to the precise direction that the road would take.&nbsp;
A frosted expanse of even grass, on which the shadow of his head appeared
with an opal halo round it, soon allowed the house to be discovered
beyond, the other portions of the park abounding with timber older and
finer than that of any other spot in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Christopher
withdrew into the shade, and wheeled round to the front of the building
that contained his old love.&nbsp; Here he gazed and idled, as many
a man has done before him&mdash;wondering which room the fair poetess
occupied, waiting till lights began to appear in the upper windows&mdash;which
they did as uncertainly as glow-worms blinking up at eventide&mdash;and
warming with currents of revived feeling in perhaps the sweetest of
all conditions.&nbsp; New love is brightest, and long love is greatest;
but revived love is the tenderest thing known upon earth.</p>
<p>Occupied thus, Christopher was greatly surprised to see, on casually
glancing to one side, another man standing close to the shadowy trunk
of another tree, in a similar attitude to his own, gazing, with arms
folded, as blankly at the windows of the house as Christopher himself
had been gazing.&nbsp; Not willing to be discovered, Christopher stuck
closer to his tree.&nbsp; While he waited thus, the stranger began murmuring
words, in a slow soft voice.&nbsp; Christopher listened till he heard
the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Pale was the day and rayless, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That had an eve so dim.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two well-known lines from one of Ethelberta&rsquo;s poems.</p>
<p>Jealousy is a familiar kind of heat which disfigures, licks playfully,
clouds, blackens, and boils a man as a fire does a pot; and on recognizing
these pilferings from what he had grown to regard as his own treasury,
Christopher&rsquo;s fingers began to nestle with great vigour in the
palms of his hands.&nbsp; Three or four minutes passed, when the unknown
rival gave a last glance at the windows, and walked away.&nbsp; Christopher
did not like the look of that walk at all&mdash;there was grace enough
in it to suggest that his antagonist had no mean chance of finding favour
in a woman&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; A sigh, too, seemed to proceed from the
stranger&rsquo;s breast; but as their distance apart was too great for
any such sound to be heard by any possibility, Christopher set down
that to imagination, or to the brushing of the wind over the trees.</p>
<p>The lighted windows went out one by one, and all the house was in
darkness.&nbsp; Julian then walked off himself, with a vigour that was
spasmodic only, and with much less brightness of mind than he had experienced
on his journey hither.&nbsp; The stranger had gone another way, and
Christopher saw no more of him.&nbsp; When he reached Sandbourne, Faith
was still sitting up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I told you I was going to take a long walk,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Christopher: really you did not.&nbsp; How tired and sad
you do look&mdash;though I always know beforehand when you are in that
state: one of your feet has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement
outside the window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I forgot that I did not tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could not begin to describe his pilgrimage: it was too silly a
thing even for her to hear of.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does not matter at all about my staying up,&rsquo; said
Faith assuringly; &lsquo;that is, if exercise benefits you.&nbsp; Walking
up and down the lane, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; not walking up and down the lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The turnpike-road to Rookington is pleasant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, that is really where I have been.&nbsp; How came you
to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only guessed.&nbsp; Verses and an accidental meeting produce
a special journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ethelberta is a fine woman, physically and mentally, both.&nbsp;
I wonder people do not talk about her twice as much as they do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then surely you are getting attached to her again.&nbsp; You
think you discover in her more than anybody else does; and love begins
with a sense of superior discernment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; That is only nonsense,&rsquo; he said hurriedly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However, love her or love her not, I can keep a corner of my
heart for you, Faith.&nbsp; There is another brute after her too, it
seems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there is: I expect there are many.&nbsp; Her position
in society is above ours, so that it is an unwise course to go troubling
yourself more about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; If a needy man must be so foolish as to fall in
love, it is best to do so where he cannot double his foolishness by
marrying the woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk so slightingly of what
poor father did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher fixed his attention on the supper.&nbsp; That night,
late as it was, when Faith was in bed and sleeping, he sat before a
sheet of music-paper, neatly copying his composition upon it.&nbsp;
The manuscript was intended as an offering to Ethelberta at the first
convenient opportunity.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, after all my trouble to find out about Ethelberta, here
comes the clue unasked for,&rsquo; said the musician to his sister a
few days later.</p>
<p>She turned and saw that he was reading the <i>Wessex Reflector</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked Faith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The secret of the true authorship of the book is out at last,
and it is Ethelberta of course.&nbsp; I am so glad to have it proved
hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But can we believe&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; Just hear what &ldquo;Our London Correspondent&rdquo;
says.&nbsp; It is one of the nicest bits of gossip that he has furnished
us with for a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: now read it, do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The author of &lsquo;Metres by E.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;
Christopher began, &lsquo;&ldquo;a book of which so much has been said
and conjectured, and one, in fact, that has been the chief talk for
several weeks past of the literary circles to which I belong, is a young
lady who was a widow before she reached the age of eighteen, and is
now not far beyond her fourth lustrum.&nbsp; I was additionally informed
by a friend whom I met yesterday on his way to the House of Lords, that
her name is Mrs. Petherwin&mdash;Christian name Ethelberta; and that
she resides with her mother-in-law at their house in Exonbury Crescent.&nbsp;
She is, moreover, the daughter of the late Bishop of Silchester (if
report may be believed), whose active benevolence, as your readers know,
left his family in comparatively straitened circumstances at his death.&nbsp;
The marriage was a secret one, and much against the wish of her husband&rsquo;s
friends, who are wealthy people on all sides.&nbsp; The death of the
bridegroom two or three weeks after the wedding led to a reconciliation;
and the young poetess was taken to the home which she still occupies,
devoted to the composition of such brilliant effusions as those the
world has lately been favoured with from her pen.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to send her your music, you can do so now,&rsquo;
said Faith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might have sent it before, but I wanted to deliver it personally.&nbsp;
However, it is all the same now, I suppose, whether I send it or not.&nbsp;
I always knew that our destinies would lie apart, though she was once
temporarily under a cloud.&nbsp; Her momentary inspiration to write
that &ldquo;Cancelled Words&rdquo; was the worst possible omen for me.&nbsp;
It showed that, thinking me no longer useful as a practical chance,
she would make me ornamental as a poetical regret.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
send the manuscript of the song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the way of business, as a composer only; and you must say
to yourself, &ldquo;Ethelberta, as thou art but woman, I dare; but as
widow I fear thee.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Christopher&rsquo;s affected carelessness, that evening
saw a great deal of nicety bestowed upon the operation of wrapping up
and sending off the song.&nbsp; He dropped it into the box and heard
it fall, and with the curious power which he possessed of setting his
wisdom to watch any particular folly in himself that it could not hinder,
speculated as he walked on the result of this first tangible step of
return to his old position as Ethelberta&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<h2>9. A LADY&rsquo;S DRAWING-ROOMS&mdash;ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S DRESSING-ROOM</h2>
<p>It was a house on the north side of Hyde Park, between ten and eleven
in the evening, and several intelligent and courteous people had assembled
there to enjoy themselves as far as it was possible to do so in a neutral
way&mdash;all carefully keeping every variety of feeling in a state
of solution, in spite of any attempt such feelings made from time to
time to crystallize on interesting subjects in hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neigh, who is that charming woman with her head built up in
a novel way even for hair architecture&mdash;the one with her back towards
us?&rsquo; said a man whose coat fitted doubtfully to a friend whose
coat fitted well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just going to ask for the same information,&rsquo; said Mr.
Neigh, determining the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal
nicety by drawing its lower portion through his fingers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have quite forgotten&mdash;cannot keep people&rsquo;s names in my head
at all; nor could my father either&mdash;nor any of my family&mdash;a
very odd thing.&nbsp; But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he turned to one of a small group of middle-aged persons near, who,
instead of skimming the surface of things in general, like the rest
of the company, were going into the very depths of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;that is the celebrated Mrs. Petherwin, the woman who
makes rhymes and prints &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said Mrs. Napper, in a detached
sentence, and then continued talking again to those on the other side
of her.</p>
<p>The two loungers went on with their observations of Ethelberta&rsquo;s
headdress, which, though not extraordinary or eccentric, did certainly
convey an idea of indefinable novelty.&nbsp; Observers were sometimes
half inclined to think that her cuts and modes were acquired by some
secret communication with the mysterious clique which orders the livery
of the fashionable world, for&mdash;and it affords a parallel to cases
in which clever thinkers in other spheres arrive independently at one
and the same conclusion&mdash;Ethelberta&rsquo;s fashion often turned
out to be the coming one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, is that the woman at last?&rsquo; said Neigh, diminishing
his broad general gaze at the room to a close criticism of Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The rhymes,&rdquo; as Mrs. Napper calls them, are not
to be despised,&rsquo; said his companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are not
quite <i>virginibus puerisque</i>, and the writer&rsquo;s opinions of
life and society differ very materially from mine, but I cannot help
admiring her in the more reflective pieces; the songs I don&rsquo;t
care for.&nbsp; The method in which she handles curious subjects, and
at the same time impresses us with a full conviction of her modesty,
is very adroit, and somewhat blinds us to the fact that no such poems
were demanded of her at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not read them,&rsquo; said Neigh, secretly wrestling
with his jaw, to prevent a yawn; &lsquo;but I suppose I must.&nbsp;
The truth is, that I never care much for reading what one ought to read;
I wish I did, but I cannot help it.&nbsp; And, no doubt, you admire
the lady immensely for writing them: I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Everybody
is so talented now-a-days that the only people I care to honour as deserving
real distinction are those who remain in obscurity.&nbsp; I am myself
hoping for a corner in some biographical dictionary when the time comes
for those works only to contain lists of the exceptional individuals
of whom nothing is known but that they lived and died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;listen.&nbsp; They are going to sing one of her songs,&rsquo;
said his friend, looking towards a bustling movement in the neighbourhood
of the piano.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe that song, &ldquo;When tapers tall,&rdquo;
has been set to music by three or four composers already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men of any note?&rsquo; said Neigh, at last beaten by his
yawn, which courtesy nevertheless confined within his person to such
an extent that only a few unimportant symptoms, such as reduced eyes
and a certain rectangular manner of mouth in speaking, were visible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scarcely,&rsquo; replied the other man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Established
writers of music do not expend their energies upon new verse until they
find that such verse is likely to endure; for should the poet be soon
forgotten, their labour is in some degree lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Artful dogs&mdash;who would have thought it?&rsquo; said Neigh,
just as an exercise in words; and they drew nearer to the piano, less
to become listeners to the singing than to be spectators of the scene
in that quarter.&nbsp; But among some others the interest in the songs
seemed to be very great; and it was unanimously wished that the young
lady who had practised the different pieces of music privately would
sing some of them now in the order of their composers&rsquo; reputations.&nbsp;
The musical persons in the room unconsciously resolved themselves into
a committee of taste.</p>
<p>One and another had been tried, when, at the end of the third, a
lady spoke to Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mrs. Petherwin,&rsquo; she said, gracefully throwing
back her face, &lsquo;your opinion is by far the most valuable.&nbsp;
In which of the cases do you consider the marriage of verse and tune
to have been most successful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta, finding these and other unexpected calls made upon herself,
came to the front without flinching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sweetest and the best that I like by far,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;is none of these.&nbsp; It is one which reached me by post only
this morning from a place in Wessex, and is written by an unheard-of
man who lives somewhere down there&mdash;a man who will be, nevertheless,
heard a great deal of some day, I hope&mdash;think.&nbsp; I have only
practised it this afternoon; but, if one&rsquo;s own judgment is worth
anything, it is the best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us have your favourite, by all means,&rsquo; said another
friend of Ethelberta&rsquo;s who was present&mdash;Mrs. Doncastle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry that I cannot oblige you, since you wish to
hear it,&rsquo; replied the poetess regretfully; &lsquo;but the music
is at home.&nbsp; I had not received it when I lent the others to Miss
Belmaine, and it is only in manuscript like the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could it not be sent for?&rsquo; suggested an enthusiast who
knew that Ethelberta lived only in the next street, appealing by a look
to her, and then to the mistress of the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, let us send for it,&rsquo; said that lady.&nbsp;
A footman was at once quietly despatched with precise directions as
to where Christopher&rsquo;s sweet production might be found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;is there going to be something interesting?&rsquo;
asked a young married friend of Mrs. Napper, who had returned to her
original spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;the best song she has written is to be sung in the
best manner to the best air that has been composed for it.&nbsp; I should
not wonder if she were going to sing it herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you know anything of Mrs. Petherwin until her name leaked
out in connection with these ballads?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but I think I recollect seeing her once before.&nbsp;
She is one of those people who are known, as one may say, by subscription:
everybody knows a little, till she is astonishingly well known altogether;
but nobody knows her entirely.&nbsp; She was the orphan child of some
clergyman, I believe.&nbsp; Lady Petherwin, her mother-in-law, has been
taking her about a great deal latterly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has apparently a very good prospect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and it is through her being of that curious undefined
character which interprets itself to each admirer as whatever he would
like to have it.&nbsp; Old men like her because she is so girlish; youths
because she is womanly; wicked men because she is good in their eyes;
good men because she is wicked in theirs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must be a very anomalous sort of woman, at that rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Like the British Constitution, she owes her success
in practice to her inconsistencies in principle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These poems must have set her up.&nbsp; She appears to be
quite the correct spectacle.&nbsp; Happy Mrs. Petherwin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The subject of their dialogue was engaged in a conversation with
Mrs. Belmaine upon the management of households&mdash;a theme provoked
by a discussion that was in progress in the pages of some periodical
of the time.&nbsp; Mrs. Belmaine was very full of the argument, and
went on from point to point till she came to servants.</p>
<p>The face of Ethelberta showed caution at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I consider that Lady Plamby pets her servants by far too much,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Belmaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, you do not know her?&nbsp; Well,
she is a woman with theories; and she lends her maids and men books
of the wrong kind for their station, and sends them to picture exhibitions
which they don&rsquo;t in the least understand&mdash;all for the improvement
of their taste, and morals, and nobody knows what besides.&nbsp; It
only makes them dissatisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The face of Ethelberta showed venturesomeness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
and dreadfully ambitious!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; What a turn the times have taken!&nbsp;
People of that sort push on, and get into business, and get great warehouses,
until at last, without ancestors, or family, or name, or estate&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or the merest scrap of heirloom or family jewel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or heirlooms, or family jewels, they are thought as much of
as if their forefathers had glided unobtrusively through the peerage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ever since the first edition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Belmaine, who really sprang from a
good old family, had been going to say, &lsquo;for the last seven hundred
years,&rsquo; but fancying from Ethelberta&rsquo;s addendum that she
might not date back more than a trifling century or so, adopted the
suggestion with her usual well-known courtesy, and blushed down to her
locket at the thought of the mistake that she might have made.&nbsp;
This sensitiveness was a trait in her character which gave great gratification
to her husband, and, indeed, to all who knew her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you any theory on the vexed question of servant-government?&rsquo;
continued Mrs. Belmaine, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But no&mdash;the subject
is of far too practical a nature for one of your bent, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;it is not at all too practical.&nbsp; I have thought
of the matter often,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think the
best plan would be for somebody to write a pamphlet, &ldquo;The Shortest
Way with the Servants,&rdquo; just as there was once written a terribly
stinging one, &ldquo;The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,&rdquo; which
had a great effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always understood that that was written by a dissenter
as a satire upon the Church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;so it was: but the example will do to illustrate
my meaning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so&mdash;I understand&mdash;so it will,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Belmaine, with clouded faculties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Christopher&rsquo;s music had arrived.&nbsp; An accomplished
gentleman who had every musical talent except that of creation, scanned
the notes carefully from top to bottom, and sat down to accompany the
singer.&nbsp; There was no lady present of sufficient confidence or
skill to venture into a song she had never seen before, and the only
one who had seen it was Ethelberta herself; she did not deny having
practised it the greater part of the afternoon, and was very willing
to sing it now if anybody would derive pleasure from the performance.&nbsp;
Then she began, and the sweetness of her singing was such that even
the most unsympathetic honoured her by looking as if they would be willing
to listen to every note the song contained if it were not quite so much
trouble to do so.&nbsp; Some were so interested that, instead of continuing
their conversation, they remained in silent consideration of how they
would continue it when she had finished; while the particularly civil
people arranged their countenances into every attentive form that the
mind could devise.&nbsp; One emotional gentleman looked at the corner
of a chair as if, till that moment, such an object had never crossed
his vision before; the movement of his finger to the imagined tune was,
for a deaf old clergyman, a perfect mine of interest; whilst a young
man from the country was powerless to put an end to an enchanted gaze
at nothing at all in the exact middle of the room before him.&nbsp;
Neigh, and the general phalanx of cool men and celebrated club yawners,
were so much affected that they raised their chronic look of great objection
to things, to an expression of scarcely any objection at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes it so interesting,&rsquo; said Mrs. Doncastle to
Ethelberta, when the song was over and she had retired from the focus
of the company, &lsquo;is, that it is played from the composer&rsquo;s
own copy, which has never met the public eye, or any other than his
own before to-day.&nbsp; And I see that he has actually sketched in
the lines by hand, instead of having ruled paper&mdash;just as the great
old composers used to do.&nbsp; You must have been as pleased to get
it fresh from the stocks like that as he probably was pleased to get
your thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta became reflective.&nbsp; She had not thanked Christopher;
moreover, she had decided, after some consideration, that she ought
not to thank him.&nbsp; What new thoughts were suggested by that remark
of Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s, and what new inclination resulted from the
public presentation of his tune and her words as parts of one organic
whole, are best explained by describing her doings at a later hour,
when, having left her friends somewhat early, she had reached home and
retired from public view for that evening.</p>
<p>Ethelberta went to her room, sent away the maid who did double duty
for herself and Lady Petherwin, walked in circles about the carpet till
the fire had grown haggard and cavernous, sighed, took a sheet of paper
and wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. JULIAN,&mdash;I have said I would not
write: I have said it twice; but discretion, under some circumstances,
is only another name for unkindness.&nbsp; Before thanking you for your
sweet gift, let me tell you in a few words of something which may materially
change an aspect of affairs under which I appear to you to deserve it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With regard to my history and origin you are altogether mistaken;
and how can I tell whether your bitterness at my previous silence on
those points may not cause you to withdraw your act of courtesy now?&nbsp;
But the gratification of having at last been honest with you may compensate
even for the loss of your respect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The matter is a small one to tell, after all.&nbsp; What will
you say on learning that I am not the trodden-down &ldquo;lady by birth&rdquo;
that you have supposed me?&nbsp; That my father is not dead, as you
probably imagine; that he is working for his living as one among a peculiarly
stigmatized and ridiculed multitude?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had he been a brawny cottager, carpenter, mason, blacksmith,
well-digger, navvy, tree-feller&mdash;any effective and manly trade,
in short, a worker in which can stand up in the face of the noblest
and daintiest, and bare his gnarled arms and say, with a consciousness
of superior power, &ldquo;Look at a real man!&rdquo; I should have been
able to show you antecedents which, if not intensely romantic, are not
altogether antagonistic to romance.&nbsp; But the present fashion of
associating with one particular class everything that is ludicrous and
bombastic overpowers me when I think of it in relation to myself and
your known sensitiveness.&nbsp; When the well-born poetess of good report
melts into. . .&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having got thus far, a faint-hearted look, which had begun to show
itself several sentences earlier, became pronounced.&nbsp; She threw
the writing into the dull fire, poked and stirred it till a red inflammation
crept over the sheet, and then started anew:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. JULIAN,&mdash;Not knowing your present
rank as composer&mdash;whether on the very brink of fame, or as yet
a long way off&mdash;I cannot decide what form of expression my earnest
acknowledgments should take.&nbsp; Let me simply say in one short phrase,
I thank you infinitely!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am no musician, and my opinion on music may not be worth
much: yet I know what I like (as everybody says, but I do not use the
words as a form to cover a hopeless blank on all connected with the
subject), and this sweet air I love.&nbsp; You must have glided like
a breeze about me&mdash;seen into a heart not worthy of scrutiny, jotted
down words that cannot justify attention&mdash;before you could have
apotheosized the song in so exquisite a manner.&nbsp; My gratitude took
the form of wretchedness when, on hearing the effect of the ballad in
public this evening, I thought that I had not power to withhold a reply
which might do us both more harm than good.&nbsp; Then I said, &ldquo;Away
with all emotion&mdash;I wish the world was drained dry of it&mdash;I
will take no notice,&rdquo; when a lady whispered at my elbow to the
effect that of course I had expressed my gratification to you.&nbsp;
I ought first to have mentioned that your creation has been played to-night
to full drawing-rooms, and the original tones cooled the artificial
air like a fountain almost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I prophesy great things of you.&nbsp; Perhaps, at the time
when we are each but a row of bones in our individual graves, your genius
will be remembered, while my mere cleverness will have been long forgotten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;you must allow a woman of experience to say this&mdash;the
undoubted power that you possess will do you socially no good unless
you mix with it the ingredient of ambition&mdash;a quality in which
I fear you are very deficient.&nbsp; It is in the hope of stimulating
you to a better opinion of yourself that I write this letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably I shall never meet you again.&nbsp; Not that I think
circumstances to be particularly powerful to prevent such a meeting,
rather it is that I shall energetically avoid it.&nbsp; There can be
no such thing as strong friendship between a man and a woman not of
one family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than that there must not be, and this is why we will
not meet.&nbsp; You see that I do not mince matters at all; but it is
hypocrisy to avoid touching upon a subject which all men and women in
our position inevitably think of, no matter what they say.&nbsp; Some
women might have written distantly, and wept at the repression of their
real feeling; but it is better to be more frank, and keep a dry eye.&mdash;Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ETHELBERTA.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her feet felt cold and her heart weak as she directed the letter,
and she was overpowered with weariness.&nbsp; But murmuring, &lsquo;If
I let it stay till the morning I shall not send it, and a man may be
lost to fame because of a woman&rsquo;s squeamishness&mdash;it shall
go,&rsquo; she partially dressed herself, wrapped a large cloak around
her, descended the stairs, and went out to the pillar-box at the corner,
leaving the door not quite close.&nbsp; No gust of wind had realized
her misgivings that it might be blown shut on her return, and she re-entered
as softly as she had emerged.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Ethelberta had said nothing about her family
after all.</p>
<h2>10. LADY PETHERWIN&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>The next day old Lady Petherwin, who had not accompanied Ethelberta
the night before, came into the morning-room, with a newspaper in her
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does this mean, Ethelberta?&rsquo; she inquired in tones
from which every shade of human expressiveness was extracted by some
awful and imminent mood that lay behind.&nbsp; She was pointing to a
paragraph under the heading of &lsquo;Literary Notes,&rsquo; which contained
in a few words the announcement of Ethelberta&rsquo;s authorship that
had more circumstantially appeared in the <i>Wessex Reflector</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It means what it says,&rsquo; said Ethelberta quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I must apologize for having kept it such a secret
from you.&nbsp; It was not done in the spirit that you may imagine:
it was merely to avoid disturbing your mind that I did it so privately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely you have not written every one of those ribald
verses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta looked inclined to exclaim most vehemently against this;
but what she actually did say was, &lsquo;&ldquo;Ribald&rdquo;&mdash;what
do you mean by that?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that you are aware what
&ldquo;ribald&rdquo; means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that I am.&nbsp; As regards some words as well
as some persons, the less you are acquainted with them the more it is
to your credit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite deserve this, Lady Petherwin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, one would imagine that women wrote their books during
those dreams in which people have no moral sense, to see how improper
some, even virtuous, ladies become when they get into print.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might have done a much more unnatural thing than write those
poems.&nbsp; And perhaps I might have done a much better thing, and
got less praise.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s fault, not
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have left them unwritten, and shown more fidelity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fidelity! it is more a matter of humour than principle.&nbsp;
What has fidelity to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fidelity to my dear boy&rsquo;s memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be difficult to show that because I have written
so-called tender and gay verse, I feel tender and gay.&nbsp; It is too
often assumed that a person&rsquo;s fancy is a person&rsquo;s real mind.&nbsp;
I believe that in the majority of cases one is fond of imagining the
direct opposite of one&rsquo;s principles in sheer effort after something
fresh and free; at any rate, some of the lightest of those rhymes were
composed between the deepest fits of dismals I have ever known.&nbsp;
However, I did expect that you might judge in the way you have judged,
and that was my chief reason for not telling you what I had done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t deny that you tried to escape from recollections
you ought to have cherished?&nbsp; There is only one thing that women
of your sort are as ready to do as to take a man&rsquo;s name, and that
is, drop his memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lady Petherwin&mdash;don&rsquo;t be so unreasonable as
to blame a live person for living!&nbsp; No woman&rsquo;s head is so
small as to be filled for life by a memory of a few months.&nbsp; Four
years have passed since I last saw my boy-husband.&nbsp; We were mere
children; see how I have altered since in mind, substance, and outline&mdash;I
have even grown half an inch taller since his death.&nbsp; Two years
will exhaust the regrets of widows who have long been faithful wives;
and ought I not to show a little new life when my husband died in the
honeymoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Accepting the protection of your husband&rsquo;s
mother was, in effect, an avowal that you rejected the idea of being
a widow to prolong the idea of being a wife; and the sin against your
conventional state thus assumed is almost as bad as would have been
a sin against the married state itself.&nbsp; If you had gone off when
he died, saying, &ldquo;Thank heaven, I am free!&rdquo; you would, at
any rate, have shown some real honesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have been more virtuous by being more unfeeling.&nbsp;
That often happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have taken to you, and made a great deal of you&mdash;given
you the inestimable advantages of foreign travel and good society to
enlarge your mind.&nbsp; In short, I have been like a Naomi to you in
everything, and I maintain that writing these poems saps the foundation
of it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do own that you have been a very good Naomi to me thus far;
but Ruth was quite a fast widow in comparison with me, and yet Naomi
never blamed her.&nbsp; You are unfortunate in your illustration.&nbsp;
But it is dreadfully flippant of me to answer you like this, for you
have been kind.&nbsp; But why will you provoke me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you are flippant, Ethelberta.&nbsp; You are too much
given to that sort of thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know how the secret of my name has leaked
out; and I am not ribald, or anything you say,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
with a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you own you do not feel so ardent as you seem in your
book?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do own it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that you are sorry your name has been published in connection
with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you think the verses may tend to misrepresent your character
as a gay and rapturous one, when it is not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do fear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, of course, you will suppress the poems instantly.&nbsp;
That is the only way in which you can regain the position you have hitherto
held with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta said nothing; and the dull winter atmosphere had far from
light enough in it to show by her face what she might be thinking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Lady Petherwin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not expect such a command as that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have been obedient for four years, and would continue so&mdash;but
I cannot suppress the poems.&nbsp; They are not mine now to suppress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must get them into your hands.&nbsp; Money will do it,
I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I suppose it would&mdash;a thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; the money shall be forthcoming,&rsquo; said Lady
Petherwin, after a pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had better sit down and write
about it at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot do it,&rsquo; said Ethelberta; &lsquo;and I will
not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish them to be suppressed.&nbsp; I am not
ashamed of them; there is nothing to be ashamed of in them; and I shall
not take any steps in the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are an ungrateful woman, and wanting in natural affection
for the dead!&nbsp; Considering your birth&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an intolerable&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Petherwin crashed out of the room in a wind of indignation,
and went upstairs and heard no more.&nbsp; Adjoining her chamber was
a smaller one called her study, and, on reaching this, she unlocked
a cabinet, took out a small deed-box, removed from it a folded packet,
unfolded it, crumpled it up, and turning round suddenly flung it into
the fire.&nbsp; Then she stood and beheld it eaten away word after word
by the flames, &lsquo;Testament&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;all that freehold&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;heirs
and assigns&rsquo; appearing occasionally for a moment only to disappear
for ever.&nbsp; Nearly half the document had turned into a glossy black
when the lady clasped her hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I done!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; Springing to
the tongs she seized with them the portion of the writing yet unconsumed,
and dragged it out of the fire.&nbsp; Ethelberta appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quick, Ethelberta!&rsquo; said Lady Petherwin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Help
me to put this out!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the two women went trampling wildly
upon the document and smothering it with a corner of the hearth-rug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My will!&rsquo; said Lady Petherwin.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have kept
it by me lately, for I have wished to look over it at leisure&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I was
just coming in to tell you that I would always cling to you, and never
desert you, ill-use me how you might!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such an affectionate remark sounds curious at such a time,&rsquo;
said Lady Petherwin, sinking down in a chair at the end of the struggle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; cried Ethelberta, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Selfishness, my dear, has given me such crooked looks that
I can see it round a corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you mean that what is yours to give may not be mine to
take, it would be as well to name it in an impersonal way, if you must
name it at all,&rsquo; said the daughter-in-law, with wet eyelids.&nbsp;
&lsquo;God knows I had no selfish thought in saying that.&nbsp; I came
upstairs to ask you to forgive me, and knew nothing about the will.&nbsp;
But every explanation distorts it all the more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We two have got all awry, dear&mdash;it cannot be concealed&mdash;awry&mdash;awry.&nbsp;
Ah, who shall set us right again?&nbsp; However, now I must send for
Mr. Chancerly&mdash;no, I am going out on other business, and I will
call upon him.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t spoil your eyes: you may have
to sell them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rang the bell and ordered the carriage; and half-an-hour later
Lady Petherwin&rsquo;s coachman drove his mistress up to the door of
her lawyer&rsquo;s office in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.</p>
<h2>11. SANDBOURNE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD&mdash;SOME LONDON STREETS</h2>
<p>While this was going on in town, Christopher, at his lodgings in
Sandbourne, had been thrown into rare old visions and dreams by the
appearance of Ethelberta&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Flattered and encouraged
to ambition as well as to love by her inspiriting sermon, he put off
now the last remnant of cynical doubt upon the genuineness of his old
mistress, and once and for all set down as disloyal a belief he had
latterly acquired that &lsquo;Come, woo me, woo me; for I am like enough
to consent,&rsquo; was all a young woman had to tell.</p>
<p>All the reasoning of political and social economists would not have
convinced Christopher that he had a better chance in London than in
Sandbourne of making a decent income by reasonable and likely labour;
but a belief in a far more improbable proposition, impetuously expressed,
warmed him with the idea that he might become famous there.&nbsp; The
greater is frequently more readily credited than the less, and an argument
which will not convince on a matter of halfpence appears unanswerable
when applied to questions of glory and honour.</p>
<p>The regulation wet towel and strong coffee of the ambitious and intellectual
student floated before him in visions; but it was with a sense of relief
that he remembered that music, in spite of its drawbacks as a means
of sustenance, was a profession happily unencumbered with those excruciating
preliminaries to greatness.</p>
<p>Christopher talked about the new move to his sister, and he was vexed
that her hopefulness was not roused to quite the pitch of his own.&nbsp;
As with others of his sort, his too general habit of accepting the most
clouded possibility that chances offered was only transcended by his
readiness to kindle with a fitful excitement now and then.&nbsp; Faith
was much more equable.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you were not the most melancholy
man God ever created,&rsquo; she said, kindly looking at his vague deep
eyes and thin face, which was but a few degrees too refined and poetical
to escape the epithet of lantern-jawed from any one who had quarrelled
with him, &lsquo;you would not mind my coolness about this.&nbsp; It
is a good thing of course to go; I have always fancied that we were
mistaken in coming here.&nbsp; Mediocrity stamped &ldquo;London&rdquo;
fetches more than talent marked &ldquo;provincial.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
I cannot feel so enthusiastic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, if we are to go, we may as well go by enthusiasm as
by calculation; it is a sensation pleasanter to the nerves, and leads
to just as good a result when there is only one result possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Faith.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not depress
you.&nbsp; If I had to describe you I should say you were a child in
your impulses, and an old man in your reflections.&nbsp; Have you considered
when we shall start?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you thought?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That we may very well leave the place in six weeks if we wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We really may?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And what is more, we will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Christopher and Faith arrived in London on an afternoon at the end
of winter, and beheld from one of the river bridges snow-white scrolls
of steam from the tall chimneys of Lambeth, rising against the livid
sky behind, as if drawn in chalk on toned cardboard.</p>
<p>The first thing he did that evening, when settled in their apartments
near the British Museum, before applying himself to the beginning of
the means by which success in life might be attained, was to go out
in the direction of Ethelberta&rsquo;s door, leaving Faith unpacking
the things, and sniffing extraordinary smoke-smells which she discovered
in all nooks and crannies of the rooms.&nbsp; It was some satisfaction
to see Ethelberta&rsquo;s house, although the single feature in which
it differed from the other houses in the Crescent was that no lamp shone
from the fanlight over the entrance&mdash;a speciality which, if he
cared for omens, was hardly encouraging.&nbsp; Fearing to linger near
lest he might be detected, Christopher stole a glimpse at the door and
at the steps, imagined what a trifle of the depression worn in each
step her feet had tended to produce, and strolled home again.</p>
<p>Feeling that his reasons for calling just now were scarcely sufficient,
he went next day about the business that had brought him to town, which
referred to a situation as organist in a large church in the north-west
district.&nbsp; The post was half ensured already, and he intended to
make of it the nucleus of a professional occupation and income.&nbsp;
Then he sat down to think of the preliminary steps towards publishing
the song that had so pleased her, and had also, as far as he could understand
from her letter, hit the popular taste very successfully; a fact which,
however little it may say for the virtues of the song as a composition,
was a great recommendation to it as a property.&nbsp; Christopher was
delighted to perceive that out of this position he could frame an admissible,
if not an unimpeachable, reason for calling upon Ethelberta.&nbsp; He
determined to do so at once, and obtain the required permission by word
of mouth.</p>
<p>He was greatly surprised, when the front of the house appeared in
view on this spring afternoon, to see what a white and sightless aspect
pervaded all the windows.&nbsp; He came close: the eyeball blankness
was caused by all the shutters and blinds being shut tight from top
to bottom.&nbsp; Possibly this had been the case for some time&mdash;he
could not tell.&nbsp; In one of the windows was a card bearing the announcement,
&lsquo;This House to be let Furnished.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here was a merciless
clash between fancy and fact.&nbsp; Regretting now his faint-heartedness
in not letting her know beforehand by some means that he was about to
make a new start in the world, and coming to dwell near her, Christopher
rang the bell to make inquiries.&nbsp; A gloomy caretaker appeared after
a while, and the young man asked whither the ladies had gone to live.&nbsp;
He was beyond measure depressed to learn that they were in the South
of France&mdash;Arles, the man thought the place was called&mdash;the
time of their return to town being very uncertain; though one thing
was clear, they meant to miss the forthcoming London season altogether.</p>
<p>As Christopher&rsquo;s hope to see her again had brought a resolve
to do so, so now resolve led to dogged patience.&nbsp; Instead of attempting
anything by letter, he decided to wait; and he waited well, occupying
himself in publishing a &lsquo;March&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Morning and
Evening Service in E flat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some four-part songs, too, engaged
his attention when the heavier duties of the day were over&mdash;these
duties being the giving of lessons in harmony and counterpoint, in which
he was aided by the introductions of a man well known in the musical
world, who had been acquainted with young Julian as a promising amateur
long before he adopted music as the staff of his pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It was the end of summer when he again tried his fortune at the house
in Exonbury Crescent.&nbsp; Scarcely calculating upon finding her at
this stagnant time of the town year, and only hoping for information,
Julian was surprised and excited to see the shutters open, and the house
wearing altogether a living look, its neighbours having decidedly died
off meanwhile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The family here,&rsquo; said a footman in answer to his inquiry,
&lsquo;are only temporary tenants of the house.&nbsp; It is not Lady
Petherwin&rsquo;s people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know the Petherwins&rsquo; present address?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Underground, sir, for the old lady.&nbsp; She died some time
ago in Switzerland, and was buried there, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mrs. Petherwin&mdash;the young lady,&rsquo; said Christopher,
starting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are not acquainted personally with the family,&rsquo; the
man replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master has only taken the house for a few
months, whilst extensive alterations are being made in his own on the
other side of the park, which he goes to look after every day.&nbsp;
If you want any further information about Lady Petherwin, Mrs. Petherwin
will probably give it.&nbsp; I can let you have her address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes; thank you,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>The footman handed him one of some cards which appeared to have been
left for the purpose.&nbsp; Julian, though tremblingly anxious to know
where Ethelberta was, did not look at it till he could take a cool survey
in private.&nbsp; The address was &lsquo;Arrowthorne Lodge, Upper Wessex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Christopher to himself, &lsquo;not far
from Melchester; and not dreadfully far from Sandbourne.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>12. ARROWTHORNE PARK AND LODGE</h2>
<p>Summer was just over when Christopher Julian found himself rattling
along in the train to Sandbourne on some trifling business appertaining
to his late father&rsquo;s affairs, which would afford him an excuse
for calling at Arrowthorne about the song of hers that he wished to
produce.&nbsp; He alighted in the afternoon at a little station some
twenty miles short of Sandbourne, and leaving his portmanteau behind
him there, decided to walk across the fields, obtain if possible the
interview with the lady, and return then to the station to finish the
journey to Sandbourne, which he could thus reach at a convenient hour
in the evening, and, if he chose, take leave of again the next day.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon which had a fungous smell out of doors, all being
sunless and stagnant overhead and around.&nbsp; The various species
of trees had begun to assume the more distinctive colours of their decline,
and where there had been one pervasive green were now twenty greenish
yellows, the air in the vistas between them being half opaque with blue
exhalation.&nbsp; Christopher in his walk overtook a countryman, and
inquired if the path they were following would lead him to Arrowthorne
Lodge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twill take &rsquo;ee into Arr&rsquo;thorne Park,&rsquo;
the man replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t come anigh the Lodge,
unless you bear round to the left as might be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin lives there, I believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Leastwise unless she&rsquo;s but lately come.&nbsp;
I have never heard of such a woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She may possibly be only visiting there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, perhaps that&rsquo;s the shape o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well,
now you tell o&rsquo;t, I have seen a strange face thereabouts once
or twice lately.&nbsp; A young good-looking maid enough, seemingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s considered a very handsome lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the woodmen say, now that you tell o&rsquo;t,
that they meet her every now and then, just at the closing in of the
day, as they come home along with their nitches of sticks; ay, stalking
about under the trees by herself&mdash;a tall black martel, so long-legged
and awful-like that you&rsquo;d think &rsquo;twas the old feller himself
a-coming, they say.&nbsp; Now a woman must be a queer body to my thinking,
to roam about by night so lonesome and that?&nbsp; Ay, now that you
tell o&rsquo;t, there is such a woman, but &rsquo;a never have showed
in the parish; sure I never thought who the body was&mdash;no, not once
about her, nor where &rsquo;a was living and that&mdash;not I, till
you spoke.&nbsp; Well, there, sir, that&rsquo;s Arr&rsquo;thorne Lodge;
do you see they three elms?&rsquo;&nbsp; He pointed across the glade
towards some confused foliage a long way off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure about the sort of tree you mean,&rsquo; said
Christopher, &lsquo;I see a number of trees with edges shaped like edges
of clouds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, they be oaks; I mean the elms to the left hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But a man can hardly tell oaks from elms at that distance,
my good fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That &rsquo;a can very well&mdash;leastwise, if he&rsquo;s
got the sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I think I see what you mean,&rsquo; said Christopher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you get there, you bear away smart to nor&rsquo;-west,
and you&rsquo;ll come straight as a line to the Lodge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How the deuce am I to know which is north-west in a strange
place, with no sun to tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, not know nor-west?&nbsp; Well, I should think a boy
could never live and grow up to be a man without knowing the four quarters.&nbsp;
I knowed &rsquo;em when I was a mossel of a chiel.&nbsp; We be no great
scholars here, that&rsquo;s true, but there isn&rsquo;t a Tom-rig or
Jack-straw in these parts that don&rsquo;t know where they lie as well
as I.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve lived, man and boy, these eight-and-sixty
years, and never met a man in my life afore who hadn&rsquo;t learnt
such a common thing as the four quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher parted from his companion and soon reached a stile, clambering
over which he entered a park.&nbsp; Here he threaded his way, and rounding
a clump of aged trees the young man came in view of a light and elegant
country-house in the half-timbered Gothic style of the late revival,
apparently only a few years old.&nbsp; Surprised at finding himself
so near, Christopher&rsquo;s heart fluttered unmanageably till he had
taken an abstract view of his position, and, in impatience at his want
of nerve, adopted a sombre train of reasoning to convince himself that,
far from indulgence in the passion of love bringing bliss, it was a
folly, leading to grief and disquiet&mdash;certainly one which would
do him no good.&nbsp; Cooled down by this, he stepped into the drive
and went up to the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mrs. Petherwin at home?&rsquo; he said modestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who did you say, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know the person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady may be a visitor&mdash;I call on business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not visiting in this house, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not this Arrowthorne Lodge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then where is Arrowthorne Lodge, please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is nearly a mile from here.&nbsp; Under the trees
by the high-road.&nbsp; If you go across by that footpath it will bring
you out quicker than by following the bend of the drive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher wondered how he could have managed to get into the wrong
park; but, setting it down to his ignorance of the difference between
oak and elm, he immediately retraced his steps, passing across the park
again, through the gate at the end of the drive, and into the turnpike
road.&nbsp; No other gate, park, or country seat of any description
was within view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you tell me the way to Arrowthorne Lodge?&rsquo; he inquired
of the first person he met, who was a little girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are just coming away from it, sir,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you; I am going that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked along together.&nbsp; Getting abreast the entrance of
the park he had just emerged from, the child said, &lsquo;There it is,
sir; I live there too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher, with a dazed countenance, looked towards a cottage which
stood nestling in the shrubbery and ivy like a mushroom among grass.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is that Arrowthorne Lodge?&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and if you go up the drive, you come to Arrowthorne House.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arrowthorne Lodge&mdash;where Mrs. Petherwin lives, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; She lives there along wi&rsquo; mother and we.&nbsp;
But she don&rsquo;t want anybody to know it, sir, cause she&rsquo;s
celebrate, and &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t do at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher said no more, and the little girl became interested in
the products of the bank and ditch by the wayside.&nbsp; He left her,
pushed open the heavy gate, and tapped at the Lodge door.</p>
<p>The latch was lifted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Does Mrs. Petherwin,&rsquo; he
began, and, determined that there should be no mistake, repeated, &lsquo;Does
Mrs. Ethelberta Petherwin, the poetess, live here?&rsquo; turning full
upon the person who opened the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does, sir,&rsquo; said a faltering voice; and he found
himself face to face with the pupil-teacher of Sandbourne.</p>
<h2>13. THE LODGE (continued)&mdash;THE COPSE BEHIND</h2>
<p>&lsquo;This is indeed a surprise; I&mdash;am glad to see you!&rsquo;
Christopher stammered, with a wire-drawn, radically different smile
from the one he had intended&mdash;a smile not without a tinge of ghastliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I am home for the holidays,&rsquo; said the blushing
maiden; and, after a critical pause, she added, &lsquo;If you wish to
speak to my sister, she is in the plantation with the children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;no, thank you&mdash;not necessary at all,&rsquo;
said Christopher, in haste.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only wish for an interview
with a lady called Mrs. Petherwin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; Mrs Petherwin&mdash;my sister,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She is in the plantation.&nbsp; That little path will take you
to her in five minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The amazed Christopher persuaded himself that this discovery was
very delightful, and went on persuading so long that at last he felt
it to be so.&nbsp; Unable, like many other people, to enjoy being satirized
in words because of the irritation it caused him as aimed-at victim,
he sometimes had philosophy enough to appreciate a satire of circumstance,
because nobody intended it.&nbsp; Pursuing the path indicated, he found
himself in a thicket of scrubby undergrowth, which covered an area enclosed
from the park proper by a decaying fence.&nbsp; The boughs were so tangled
that he was obliged to screen his face with his hands, to escape the
risk of having his eyes filliped out by the twigs that impeded his progress.&nbsp;
Thus slowly advancing, his ear caught, between the rustles, the tones
of a voice in earnest declamation; and, pushing round in that direction,
he beheld through some beech boughs an open space about ten yards in
diameter, floored at the bottom with deep beds of curled old leaves,
and cushions of furry moss.&nbsp; In the middle of this natural theatre
was the stump of a tree that had been felled by a saw, and upon the
flat stool thus formed stood Ethelberta, whom Christopher had not beheld
since the ball at Wyndway House.</p>
<p>Round her, leaning against branches or prostrate on the ground, were
five or six individuals.&nbsp; Two were young mechanics&mdash;one of
them evidently a carpenter.&nbsp; Then there was a boy about thirteen,
and two or three younger children.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s appearance
answered as fully as ever to that of an English lady skilfully perfected
in manner, carriage, look, and accent; and the incongruity of her present
position among lives which had had many of Nature&rsquo;s beauties stamped
out of them, and few of the beauties of Art stamped in, brought him,
as a second feeling, a pride in her that almost equalled his first sentiment
of surprise.&nbsp; Christopher&rsquo;s attention was meanwhile attracted
from the constitution of the group to the words of the speaker in the
centre of it&mdash;words to which her auditors were listening with still
attention.</p>
<p>It appeared to Christopher that Ethelberta had lately been undergoing
some very extraordinary experiences.&nbsp; What the beginning of them
had been he could not in the least understand, but the portion she was
describing came distinctly to his ears, and he wondered more and more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He came forward till he, like myself, was about twenty yards
from the edge.&nbsp; I instinctively grasped my useless stiletto.&nbsp;
How I longed for the assistance which a little earlier I had so much
despised!&nbsp; Reaching the block or boulder upon which I had been
sitting, he clasped his arms around from behind; his hands closed upon
the empty seat, and he jumped up with an oath.&nbsp; This method of
attack told me a new thing with wretched distinctness; he had, as I
suppose, discovered my sex, male attire was to serve my turn no longer.&nbsp;
The next instant, indeed, made it clear, for he exclaimed, &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t escape me, masquerading madam,&rdquo; or some such words,
and came on.&nbsp; My only hope was that in his excitement he might
forget to notice where the grass terminated near the edge of the cliff,
though this could be easily felt by a careful walker: to make my own
feeling more distinct on this point I hastily bared my feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The listeners moistened their lips, Ethelberta took breath, and then
went on to describe the scene that ensued, &lsquo;A dreadful variation
on the game of Blindman&rsquo;s buff,&rsquo; being the words by which
she characterized it.</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s manner had become so impassioned at this point
that the lips of her audience parted, the children clung to their elders,
and Christopher could control himself no longer.&nbsp; He thrust aside
the boughs, and broke in upon the group.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Ethelberta,&rsquo; he exclaimed with
great excitement, &lsquo;where did you meet with such a terrible experience
as that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children shrieked, as if they thought that the interruption was
in some way the catastrophe of the events in course of narration.&nbsp;
Every one started up; the two young mechanics stared, and one of them
inquired, in return, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher had not yet made reply when Ethelberta stepped from her
pedestal down upon the crackling carpet of deep leaves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Julian!&rsquo; said she, in a serene voice, turning upon
him eyes of such a disputable stage of colour, between brown and grey,
as would have commended itself to a gallant duellist of the last century
as a point on which it was absolutely necessary to take some friend&rsquo;s
life or other.&nbsp; But the calmness was artificially done, and the
astonishment that did not appear in Ethelberta&rsquo;s tones was expressed
by her gaze.&nbsp; Christopher was not in a mood to draw fine distinctions
between recognized and unrecognized organs of speech.&nbsp; He replied
to the eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I own that your surprise is natural,&rsquo; he said, with
an anxious look into her face, as if he wished to get beyond this interpolated
scene to something more congenial and understood.&nbsp; &lsquo;But my
concern at such a history of yourself since I last saw you is even more
natural than your surprise at my manner of breaking in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That history would justify any conduct in one who hears it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were true,&rsquo; added Ethelberta, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
it is as false as&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She could name nothing notoriously
false without raising an image of what was disagreeable, and she continued
in a better manner: &lsquo;The story I was telling is entirely a fiction,
which I am getting up for a particular purpose&mdash;very different
from what appears at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry there was such a misunderstanding,&rsquo; Christopher
stammered, looking upon the ground uncertain and ashamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet
I am not, either, for I am very glad you have not undergone such trials,
of course.&nbsp; But the fact is, I&mdash;being in the neighbourhood&mdash;I
ventured to call on a matter of business, relating to a poem which I
had the pleasure of setting to music at the beginning of the year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta was only a little less ill at ease than Christopher showed
himself to be by this way of talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you walk slowly on?&rsquo; she said gently to the two
young men, &lsquo;and take the children with you; this gentleman wishes
to speak to me on business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The biggest young man caught up a little one under his arm, and plunged
amid the boughs; another little one lingered behind for a few moments
to look shyly at Christopher, with an oblique manner of hiding her mouth
against her shoulder and her eyes behind her pinafore.&nbsp; Then she
vanished, the boy and the second young man followed, and Ethelberta
and Christopher stood within the wood-bound circle alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I have caused no inconvenience by interrupting the
proceedings,&rsquo; said Christopher softly; &lsquo;but I so very much
wished to see you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you, indeed&mdash;really wish to see me?&rsquo; she said
gladly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind inconvenience then; it is a word which
seems shallow in meaning under the circumstances.&nbsp; I surely must
say that a visit is to my advantage, must I not?&nbsp; I am not as I
was, you see, and may receive as advantages what I used to consider
as troubles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has your life really changed so much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has changed.&nbsp; But what I first meant was that an interesting
visitor at a wrong time is better than a stupid one at a right time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had been behind the trees for some minutes, looking at you,
and thinking of you; but what you were doing rather interrupted my first
meditation.&nbsp; I had thought of a meeting in which we should continue
our intercourse at the point at which it was broken off years ago, as
if the omitted part had not existed at all; but something, I cannot
tell what, has upset all that feeling, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can soon tell you the meaning of my extraordinary performance,&rsquo;
Ethelberta broke in quickly, and with a little trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
mother-in-law, Lady Petherwin, is dead; and she has left me nothing
but her house and furniture in London&mdash;more than I deserve, but
less than she had distinctly led me to expect; and so I am somewhat
in a corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is always so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not always, I think.&nbsp; But this is how it happened.&nbsp;
Lady Petherwin was very capricious; when she was not foolishly kind
she was unjustly harsh.&nbsp; A great many are like it, never thinking
what a good thing it would be, instead of going on tacking from side
to side between favour and cruelty, to keep to a mean line of common
justice.&nbsp; And so we quarrelled, and she, being absolute mistress
of all her wealth, destroyed her will that was in my favour, and made
another, leaving me nothing but the fag-end of the lease of the town-house
and the furniture in it.&nbsp; Then, when we were abroad, she turned
to me again, forgave everything, and, becoming ill afterwards, wrote
a letter to the brother, to whom she had left the bulk of her property,
stating that I was to have twenty-thousand of the one-hundred-thousand
pounds she had bequeathed to him&mdash;as in the original will&mdash;doing
this by letter in case anything should happen to her before a new will
could be considered, drawn, and signed, and trusting to his honour quite
that he would obey her expressed wish should she die abroad.&nbsp; Well,
she did die, in the full persuasion that I was provided for; but her
brother (as I secretly expected all the time) refused to be morally
bound by a document which had no legal value, and the result is that
he has everything, except, of course, the furniture and the lease.&nbsp;
It would have been enough to break the heart of a person who had calculated
upon getting a fortune, which I never did; for I felt always like an
intruder and a bondswoman, and had wished myself out of the Petherwin
family a hundred times, with my crust of bread and liberty.&nbsp; For
one thing, I was always forbidden to see my relatives, and it pained
me much.&nbsp; Now I am going to move for myself, and consider that
I have a good chance of success in what I may undertake, because of
an indifference I feel about succeeding which gives the necessary coolness
that any great task requires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I presume you mean to write more poems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot&mdash;that is, I can write no more that satisfy me.&nbsp;
To blossom into rhyme on the sparkling pleasures of life, you must be
under the influence of those pleasures, and I am at present quite removed
from them&mdash;surrounded by gaunt realities of a very different description.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then try the mournful.&nbsp; Trade upon your sufferings: many
do, and thrive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no use to say that&mdash;no use at all.&nbsp; I cannot
write a line of verse.&nbsp; And yet the others flowed from my heart
like a stream.&nbsp; But nothing is so easy as to seem clever when you
have money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except to seem stupid when you have none,&rsquo; said Christopher,
looking at the dead leaves.</p>
<p>Ethelberta allowed herself to linger on that thought for a few seconds;
and continued, &lsquo;Then the question arose, what was I to do?&nbsp;
I felt that to write prose would be an uncongenial occupation, and altogether
a poor prospect for a woman like me.&nbsp; Finally I have decided to
appear in public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not on the stage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not on the stage.&nbsp; There is no novelty in a
poor lady turning actress, and novelty is what I want.&nbsp; Ordinary
powers exhibited in a new way effect as much as extraordinary powers
exhibited in an old way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;so they do.&nbsp; And extraordinary powers, and
a new way too, would be irresistible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t calculate upon both.&nbsp; I had written a prose
story by request, when it was found that I had grown utterly inane over
verse.&nbsp; It was written in the first person, and the style was modelled
after De Foe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The night before sending it off, when I
had already packed it up, I was reading about the professional story-tellers
of Eastern countries, who devoted their lives to the telling of tales.&nbsp;
I unfastened the manuscript and retained it, convinced that I should
do better by <i>telling</i> the story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well thought of!&rsquo; exclaimed Christopher, looking into
her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is a way for everybody to live, if they
can only find it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It occurred to me,&rsquo; she continued, blushing slightly,
&lsquo;that tales of the weird kind were made to be told, not written.&nbsp;
The action of a teller is wanted to give due effect to all stories of
incident; and I hope that a time will come when, as of old, instead
of an unsocial reading of fiction at home alone, people will meet together
cordially, and sit at the feet of a professed romancer.&nbsp; I am going
to tell my tales before a London public.&nbsp; As a child, I had a considerable
power in arresting the attention of other children by recounting adventures
which had never happened; and men and women are but children enlarged
a little.&nbsp; Look at this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She drew from her pocket a folded paper, shook it abroad, and disclosed
a rough draft of an announcement to the effect that Mrs. Petherwin,
Professed Story-teller, would devote an evening to that ancient form
of the romancer&rsquo;s art, at a well-known fashionable hall in London.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now you see,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;the meaning of what
you observed going on here.&nbsp; That you heard was one of three tales
I am preparing, with a view of selecting the best.&nbsp; As a reserved
one, I have the tale of my own life&mdash;to be played as a last card.&nbsp;
It was a private rehearsal before my brothers and sisters&mdash;not
with any view of obtaining their criticism, but that I might become
accustomed to my own voice in the presence of listeners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I only had had half your enterprise, what I might have
done in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now did you ever consider what a power De Foe&rsquo;s manner
would have if practised by word of mouth?&nbsp; Indeed, it is a style
which suits itself infinitely better to telling than to writing, abounding
as it does in colloquialisms that are somewhat out of place on paper
in these days, but have a wonderful power in making a narrative seem
real.&nbsp; And so, in short, I am going to talk De Foe on a subject
of my own.&nbsp; Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last word had been given tenderly, with a long-drawn sweetness,
and was caused by a look that Christopher was bending upon her at the
moment, in which he revealed that he was thinking less of the subject
she was so eagerly and hopefully descanting upon than upon her aspect
in explaining it.&nbsp; It is a fault of manner particularly common
among men newly imported into the society of bright and beautiful women;
and we will hope that, springing as it does from no unworthy source,
it is as soon forgiven in the general world as it was here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was only following a thought,&rsquo; said Christopher:&mdash;&lsquo;a
thought of how I used to know you, and then lost sight of you, and then
discovered you famous, and how we are here under these sad autumn trees,
and nobody in sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it must be tea-time,&rsquo; she said suddenly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tea is a great meal with us here&mdash;you will join us, will
you not?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Ethelberta began to make for herself a passage
through the boughs.&nbsp; Another rustle was heard a little way off,
and one of the children appeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emmeline wants to know, please, if the gentleman that come
to see &rsquo;ee will stay to tea; because, if so, she&rsquo;s agoing
to put in another spoonful for him and a bit of best green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Georgina&mdash;how candid!&nbsp; Yes, put in some best green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Christopher could say any more to her, they were emerging
by the corner of the cottage, and one of the brothers drew near them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Julian, you&rsquo;ll bide and have a cup of tea wi&rsquo;
us?&rsquo; he inquired of Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;An old friend of
yours, is he not, Mrs. Petherwin?&nbsp; Dan and I be going back to Sandbourne
to-night, and we can walk with &rsquo;ee as far as the station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be delighted,&rsquo; said Christopher; and they all
entered the cottage.&nbsp; The evening had grown clearer by this time;
the sun was peeping out just previous to departure, and sent gold wires
of light across the glades and into the windows, throwing a pattern
of the diamond quarries, and outlines of the geraniums in pots, against
the opposite wall.&nbsp; One end of the room was polygonal, such a shape
being dictated by the exterior design; in this part the windows were
placed, as at the east end of continental churches.&nbsp; Thus, from
the combined effects of the ecclesiastical lancet lights and the apsidal
shape of the room, it occurred to Christopher that the sisters were
all a delightful set of pretty saints, exhibiting themselves in a lady
chapel, and backed up by unkempt major prophets, as represented by the
forms of their big brothers.</p>
<p>Christopher sat down to tea as invited, squeezing himself in between
two children whose names were almost as long as their persons, and whose
tin cups discoursed primitive music by means of spoons rattled inside
them until they were filled.&nbsp; The tea proceeded pleasantly, notwithstanding
that the cake, being a little burnt, tasted on the outside like the
latter plums in snapdragon.&nbsp; Christopher never could meet the eye
of Picotee, who continued in a wild state of flushing all the time,
fixing her looks upon the sugar-basin, except when she glanced out of
the window to see how the evening was going on, and speaking no word
at all unless it was to correct a small sister of somewhat crude manners
as regards filling the mouth, which Picotee did in a whisper, and a
gentle inclination of her mouth to the little one&rsquo;s ear, and a
still deeper blush than before.</p>
<p>Their visitor next noticed that an additional cup-and-saucer and
plate made their appearance occasionally at the table, were silently
replenished, and then carried off by one of the children to an inner
apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our mother is bedridden,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, noticing
Christopher&rsquo;s look at the proceeding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Emmeline attends
to the household, except when Picotee is at home, and Joey attends to
the gate; but our mother&rsquo;s affliction is a very unfortunate thing
for the poor children.&nbsp; We are thinking of a plan of living which
will, I hope, be more convenient than this is; but we have not yet decided
what to do.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this minute a carriage and pair of horses
became visible through one of the angular windows of the apse, in the
act of turning in from the highway towards the park gate.&nbsp; The
boy who answered to the name of Joey sprang up from the table with the
promptness of a Jack-in-the-box, and ran out at the door.&nbsp; Everybody
turned as the carriage passed through the gate, which Joey held open,
putting his other hand where the brim of his hat would have been if
he had worn one, and lapsing into a careless boy again the instant that
the vehicle had gone by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tremendous large dinner-party at the House
to-night,&rsquo; said Emmeline methodically, looking at the equipage
over the edge of her teacup, without leaving off sipping.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
was Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a wicked old man, they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere?&rsquo; said Ethelberta musingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
used to know some friends of his.&nbsp; In what way is he wicked?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Emmeline, with simplicity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose it is because he breaks the commandments.&nbsp; But
I wonder how a big rich lord can want to steal anything.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Emmeline&rsquo;s thoughts of breaking commandments instinctively fell
upon the eighth, as being in her ideas the only case wherein the gain
could be considered as at all worth the hazard.</p>
<p>Ethelberta said nothing; but Christopher thought that a shade of
depression passed over her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hook back the gate, Joey,&rsquo; shouted Emmeline, when the
carriage had proceeded up the drive.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s more
to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey did as ordered, and by the time he got indoors another carriage
turned in from the public road&mdash;a one-horse brougham this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know who that is: that&rsquo;s Mr. Ladywell,&rsquo; said
Emmeline, in the same matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been
here afore: he&rsquo;s a distant relation of the squire&rsquo;s, and
he once gave me sixpence for picking up his gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I live to see?&rsquo; murmured the poetess, under
her breath, nearly dropping her teacup in an involuntary trepidation,
from which she made it a point of dignity to recover in a moment.&nbsp;
Christopher&rsquo;s eyes, at that exhibition from Ethelberta, entered
her own like a pair of lances.&nbsp; Picotee, seeing Christopher&rsquo;s
quick look of jealousy, became involved in her turn, and grew pale as
a lily in her endeavours to conceal the complications to which it gave
birth in her poor little breast likewise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You judge me very wrongly,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, in answer
to Christopher&rsquo;s hasty look of resentment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In supposing Mr. Ladywell to be a great friend of yours?&rsquo;
said Christopher, who had in some indescribable way suddenly assumed
a right to Ethelberta as his old property.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: for I hardly know him, and certainly do not value him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this there was something in the mutual look of the two, though
their words had been private, which did not tend to remove the anguish
of fragile Picotee.&nbsp; Christopher, assured that Ethelberta&rsquo;s
embarrassment had been caused by nothing more than the sense of her
odd social subsidence, recovered more bliss than he had lost, and regarded
calmly the profile of young Ladywell between the two windows of his
brougham as it passed the open cottage door, bearing him along unconscious
as the dead of the nearness of his beloved one, and of the sad buffoonery
that fate, fortune, and the guardian angels had been playing with Ethelberta
of late.&nbsp; He recognized the face as that of the young man whom
he had encountered when watching Ethelberta&rsquo;s window from Rookington
Park.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you remember seeing him at the Christmas dance at
Wyndway?&rsquo; she inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a good-natured fellow.&nbsp;
Afterwards he sent me that portfolio of sketches you see in the corner.&nbsp;
He might possibly do something in the world as a painter if he were
obliged to work at the art for his bread, which he is not.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She added with bitter pleasantry: &lsquo;In bare mercy to his self-respect
I must remain unseen here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It impressed Christopher to perceive how, under the estrangement
which arose from differences of education, surroundings, experience,
and talent, the sympathies of close relationship were perceptible in
Ethelberta&rsquo;s bearing towards her brothers and sisters.&nbsp; At
a remark upon some simple pleasure wherein she had not participated
because absent and occupied by far more comprehensive interests, a gloom
as of banishment would cross her face and dim it for awhile, showing
that the free habits and enthusiasms of country life had still their
charm with her, in the face of the subtler gratifications of abridged
bodices, candlelight, and no feelings in particular, which prevailed
in town.&nbsp; Perhaps the one condition which could work up into a
permanent feeling the passing revival of his fancy for a woman whose
chief attribute he had supposed to be sprightliness was added now by
the romantic ubiquity of station that attached to her.&nbsp; A discovery
which might have grated on the senses of a man wedded to conventionality
was a positive pleasure to one whose faith in society had departed with
his own social ruin.</p>
<p>The room began to darken, whereupon Christopher arose to leave; and
the brothers Sol and Dan offered to accompany him.</p>
<h2>14. A TURNPIKE ROAD</h2>
<p>&lsquo;We be thinking of coming to London ourselves soon,&rsquo;
said Sol, a carpenter and joiner by trade, as he walked along at Christopher&rsquo;s
left hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s so much more chance for a man
up the country.&nbsp; Now, if you was me, how should you set about getting
a job, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am a very good staircase hand; and I have been called
neat at sash-frames; and I can knock together doors and shutters very
well; and I can do a little at the cabinet-making.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mind framing a roof, neither, if the rest be busy; and I am always ready
to fill up my time at planing floor-boards by the foot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I can mix and lay flat tints,&rsquo; said Dan, who was
a house painter, &lsquo;and pick out mouldings, and grain in every kind
of wood you can mention&mdash;oak, maple, walnut, satinwood, cherry-tree&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can both do too much to stand the least chance of being
allowed to do anything in a city, where limitation is all the rule in
labour.&nbsp; To have any success, Sol, you must be a man who can thoroughly
look at a door to see what ought to be done to it, but as to looking
at a window, that&rsquo;s not your line; or a person who, to the remotest
particular, understands turning a screw, but who does not profess any
knowledge of how to drive a nail.&nbsp; Dan must know how to paint blue
to a marvel, but must be quite in the dark about painting green.&nbsp;
If you stick to some such principle of specialty as this, you may get
employment in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rsquo; said Dan, striking at a stone in the road
with the stout green hazel he carried.&nbsp; &lsquo;A wink is as good
as a nod: thank&rsquo;ee&mdash;we&rsquo;ll mind all that now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we do come,&rsquo; said Sol, &lsquo;we shall not mix up
with Mrs. Petherwin at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; (Perhaps you think it odd that we call her &ldquo;Mrs.
Petherwin,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s by agreement as safer and better
than Berta, because we be such rough chaps you see, and she&rsquo;s
so lofty.)&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould demean her to claim kin wi&rsquo; her
in London&mdash;two journeymen like we, that know nothing besides our
trades.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Christopher, by way of chiming in
in the friendliest manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would be pleased to see
any straightforward honest man and brother, I should think, notwithstanding
that she has moved in other society for a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know Berta!&rsquo; said Dan, looking as
if he did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&mdash;in what way do you mean?&rsquo; said Christopher
uneasily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So lofty&mdash;so very lofty!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t she, Sol?&nbsp;
Why she&rsquo;ll never stir out from mother&rsquo;s till after dark,
and then her day begins; and she&rsquo;ll traipse about under the trees,
and never go into the high-road, so that nobody in the way of gentle-people
shall run up against her and know her living in such a little small
hut after biding in a big mansion-place.&nbsp; There, we don&rsquo;t
find fault wi&rsquo; her about it: we like her just the same, though
she don&rsquo;t speak to us in the street; for a feller must be a fool
to make a piece of work about a woman&rsquo;s pride, when &rsquo;tis
his own sister, and hang upon her and bother her when he knows &rsquo;tis
for her good that he should not.&nbsp; Yes, her life has been quare
enough.&nbsp; I hope she enjoys it, but for my part I like plain sailing.&nbsp;
None of your ups and downs for me.&nbsp; There, I suppose &rsquo;twas
her nater to want to look into the world a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father and mother kept Berta to school, you understand, sir,&rsquo;
explained the more thoughtful Sol, &lsquo;because she was such a quick
child, and they always had a notion of making a governess of her.&nbsp;
Sums?&nbsp; If you said to that child, &ldquo;Berta, &rsquo;levenpence-three-farthings
a day, how much a year?&rdquo; she would tell &rsquo;ee in three seconds
out of her own little head.&nbsp; And that hard sum about the herrings
she had done afore she was nine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, she had,&rsquo; said Dan.&nbsp; &lsquo;And we all know
that to do that is to do something that&rsquo;s no nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the sum?&rsquo; Christopher inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;not know the sum about the herrings?&rsquo; said
Dan, spreading his gaze all over Christopher in amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never heard of it,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why down in these parts just as you try a man&rsquo;s soul
by the Ten Commandments, you try his head by that there sum&mdash;hey,
Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, that we do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A herring and a half for three-halfpence, how many can ye
get for &rsquo;levenpence: that&rsquo;s the feller; and a mortal teaser
he is, I assure &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Our parson, who&rsquo;s not altogether
without sense o&rsquo; week days, said one afternoon, &ldquo;If cunning
can be found in the multiplication table at all, Chickerel, &rsquo;tis
in connection with that sum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, Berta was so clever
in arithmetic that she was asked to teach summing at Miss Courtley&rsquo;s,
and there she got to like foreign tongues more than ciphering, and at
last she hated ciphering, and took to books entirely.&nbsp; Mother and
we were very proud of her at that time: not that we be stuck-up people
at all&mdash;be we, Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all; nobody can say that we be that, though there&rsquo;s
more of it in the country than there should be by all account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised to see how vain the girls about here
be getting.&nbsp; Little rascals, why they won&rsquo;t curtsey to the
loftiest lady in the land; no, not if you were to pay &rsquo;em to do
it.&nbsp; Now, the men be different.&nbsp; Any man will touch his hat
for a pint of beer.&nbsp; But then, of course, there&rsquo;s some difference
between the two.&nbsp; Touching your hat is a good deal less to do than
bending your knees, as Berta used to say, when she was blowed up for
not doing it.&nbsp; She was always one of the independent sort&mdash;you
never seed such a maid as she was!&nbsp; Now, Picotee was quite the
other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Picotee left Sandbourne entirely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; she is home for the holidays.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Julian,
our road parts from yours just here, unless you walk into the next town
along with us.&nbsp; But I suppose you get across to this station and
go by rail?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am obliged to go that way for my portmanteau,&rsquo; said
Christopher, &lsquo;or I should have been pleased to walk further.&nbsp;
Shall I see you in Sandbourne to-morrow?&nbsp; I hope so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis hardly likely that you will see
us&mdash;hardly.&nbsp; We know how unpleasant it is for a high sort
of man to have rough chaps like us hailing him, so we think it best
not to meet you&mdash;thank you all the same.&nbsp; So if you should
run up against us in the street, we should be just as well pleased by
your taking no notice, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill
save so much awkwardness&mdash;being in our working clothes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
always the plan that Mrs. Petherwin and we agree to act upon, and we
find it best for both.&nbsp; I hope you take our meaning right, and
as no offence, Mr. Julian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you do the same with Picotee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lord, no&mdash;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t a bit of use to try.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the worst of Picotee&mdash;there&rsquo;s no getting rid
of her.&nbsp; The more in the rough we be the more she&rsquo;ll stick
to us; and if we say she shan&rsquo;t come, she&rsquo;ll bide and fret
about it till we be forced to let her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher laughed, and promised, on condition that they would retract
the statement about their not being proud; and then he wished his friends
good-night.</p>
<h2>15. AN INNER ROOM AT THE LODGE</h2>
<p>At the Lodge at this time a discussion of some importance was in
progress.&nbsp; The scene was Mrs. Chickerel&rsquo;s bedroom, to which,
unfortunately, she was confined by some spinal complaint; and here she
now appeared as an interesting woman of five-and-forty, properly dressed
as far as visible, and propped up in a bed covered with a quilt which
presented a field of little squares in many tints, looking altogether
like a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of a market garden.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chickerel had been nurse in a nobleman&rsquo;s family until
her marriage, and after that she played the part of wife and mother,
upon the whole, affectionately and well.&nbsp; Among her minor differences
with her husband had been one about the naming of the children; a matter
that was at last compromised by an agreement under which the choice
of the girls&rsquo; names became her prerogative, and that of the boys&rsquo;
her husband&rsquo;s, who limited his field of selection to strict historical
precedent as a set-off to Mrs. Chickerel&rsquo;s tendency to stray into
the regions of romance.</p>
<p>The only grown-up daughters at home, Ethelberta and Picotee, with
their brother Joey, were sitting near her; the two youngest children,
Georgina and Myrtle, who had been strutting in and out of the room,
and otherwise endeavouring to walk, talk, and speak like the gentleman
just gone away, were packed off to bed.&nbsp; Emmeline, of that transitional
age which causes its exponent to look wistfully at the sitters when
romping and at the rompers when sitting, uncertain whether her position
in the household is that of child or woman, was idling in a corner.&nbsp;
The two absent brothers and two absent sisters&mdash;eldest members
of the family&mdash;completed the round ten whom Mrs. Chickerel with
thoughtless readiness had presented to a crowded world, to cost Ethelberta
many wakeful hours at night while she revolved schemes how they might
be decently maintained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I still think,&rsquo; Ethelberta was saying, &lsquo;that the
plan I first proposed is the best.&nbsp; I am convinced that it will
not do to attempt to keep on the Lodge.&nbsp; If we are all together
in town, I can look after you much better than when you are far away
from me down here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we not interfere with you&mdash;your plans for keeping
up your connections?&rsquo; inquired her mother, glancing up towards
Ethelberta by lifting the flesh of her forehead, instead of troubling
to raise her face altogether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not nearly so much as by staying here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Picotee, &lsquo;if you let lodgings, won&rsquo;t
the gentlemen and ladies know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought of that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, &lsquo;and
this is how I shall manage.&nbsp; In the first place, if mother is there,
the lodgings can be let in her name, all bills will be receipted by
her, and all tradesmen&rsquo;s orders will be given as from herself.&nbsp;
Then, we will take no English lodgers at all; we will advertise the
rooms only in Continental newspapers, as suitable for a French or German
gentleman or two, and by this means there will be little danger of my
acquaintance discovering that my house is not entirely a private one,
or of any lodger being a friend of my acquaintance.&nbsp; I have thought
over every possible way of combining the dignified social position I
must maintain to make my story-telling attractive, with my absolute
lack of money, and I can see no better one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if Gwendoline is to be your cook, she must soon give
notice at her present place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Everything depends upon Gwendoline and Cornelia.&nbsp;
But there is time enough for them to give notice&mdash;Christmas will
be soon enough.&nbsp; If they cannot or will not come as cook and housemaid,
I am afraid the plan will break down.&nbsp; A vital condition is that
I do not have a soul in the house (beyond the lodgers) who is not one
of my own relations.&nbsp; When we have put Joey into buttons, he will
do very well to attend to the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; said Joey, after a glassy look at
his future appearance in the position alluded to, &lsquo;that any of
your gentle-people come to see ye, and when I opens the door and lets
&rsquo;em in a swinging big lodger stalks downstairs.&nbsp; What will
&rsquo;em think?&nbsp; Up will go their eye-glasses at one another till
they glares each other into holes.&nbsp; My gracious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The one who calls will only think that another visitor is
leaving, Joey.&nbsp; But I shall have no visitors, or very few.&nbsp;
I shall let it be well known among my late friends that my mother is
an invalid, and that on this account we receive none but the most intimate
friends.&nbsp; These intimate friends not existing, we receive nobody
at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except Sol and Dan, if they get a job in London?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
have to call upon us at the back door, won&rsquo;t they, Berta?&rsquo;
said Joey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must go down the area steps.&nbsp; But they will not
mind that; they like the idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And father, too, must he go down the steps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may come whichever way he likes.&nbsp; He will be glad
enough to have us near at any price.&nbsp; I know that he is not at
all happy at leaving you down here, and he away in London.&nbsp; You
remember that he has only taken the situation at Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s
on the supposition that you all come to town as soon as he can see an
opening for getting you there; and as nothing of the sort has offered
itself to him, this will be the very thing.&nbsp; Of course, if I succeed
wonderfully well in my schemes for story-tellings, readings of my ballads
and poems, lectures on the art of versification, and what not, we need
have no lodgers; and then we shall all be living a happy family&mdash;all
taking our share in keeping the establishment going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except poor me!&rsquo; sighed the mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear mother, you will be necessary as a steadying power&mdash;a
flywheel, in short, to the concern.&nbsp; I wish that father could live
there, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never give up his present way of life&mdash;it
has grown to be a part of his nature.&nbsp; Poor man, he never feels
at home except in somebody else&rsquo;s house, and is nervous and quite
a stranger in his own.&nbsp; Sich is the fatal effects of service!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O mother, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Ethelberta tenderly, but
with her teeth on edge; and Picotee curled up her toes, fearing that
her mother was going to moralize.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what I mean is, that your father would not like to live
upon your earnings, and so forth.&nbsp; But in town we shall be near
him&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort, certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I shall not be wanted at all,&rsquo; said Picotee, in
a melancholy tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is much better to stay where you are,&rsquo; her mother
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will come and spend the holidays with us, of
course, as you do now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to live in London best,&rsquo; murmured Picotee,
her head sinking mournfully to one side.&nbsp; &lsquo;I HATE being in
Sandbourne now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Ethelberta severely.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
are all contriving how to live most comfortably, and it is by far the
best thing for you to stay at the school.&nbsp; You used to be happy
enough there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee sighed, and said no more.</p>
<h2>16. A LARGE PUBLIC HALL</h2>
<p>It was the second week in February, Parliament had just met, and
Ethelberta appeared for the first time before an audience in London.</p>
<p>There was some novelty in the species of entertainment that the active
young woman had proposed to herself, and this doubtless had due effect
in collecting the body of strangers that greeted her entry, over and
above those friends who came to listen to her as a matter of course.&nbsp;
Men and women who had become totally indifferent to new actresses, new
readers, and new singers, once more felt the freshness of curiosity
as they considered the promise of the announcement.&nbsp; But the chief
inducement to attend lay in the fact that here was to be seen in the
flesh a woman with whom the tongue of rumour had been busy in many romantic
ways&mdash;a woman who, whatever else might be doubted, had certainly
produced a volume of verses which had been the talk of the many who
had read them, and of the many more who had not, for several consecutive
weeks.</p>
<p>What was her story to be?&nbsp; Persons interested in the inquiry&mdash;a
small proportion, it may be owned, of the whole London public, and chiefly
young men&mdash;answered this question for themselves by assuming that
it would take the form of some pungent and gratifying revelation of
the innermost events of her own life, from which her gushing lines had
sprung as an inevitable consequence, and which being once known, would
cause such musical poesy to appear no longer wonderful.</p>
<p>The front part of the room was well filled, rows of listeners showing
themselves like a drilled-in crop of which not a seed has failed.&nbsp;
They were listeners of the right sort, a majority having noses of the
prominent and dignified type, which when viewed in oblique perspective
ranged as regularly as bow-windows at a watering place.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s
plan was to tell her pretended history and adventures while sitting
in a chair&mdash;as if she were at her own fireside, surrounded by a
circle of friends.&nbsp; By this touch of domesticity a great appearance
of truth and naturalness was given, though really the attitude was at
first more difficult to maintain satisfactorily than any one wherein
stricter formality should be observed.&nbsp; She gently began her subject,
as if scarcely knowing whether a throng were near her or not, and, in
her fear of seeming artificial, spoke too low.&nbsp; This defect, however,
she soon corrected, and ultimately went on in a charmingly colloquial
manner.&nbsp; What Ethelberta relied upon soon became evident.&nbsp;
It was not upon the intrinsic merits of her story as a piece of construction,
but upon her method of telling it.&nbsp; Whatever defects the tale possessed&mdash;and
they were not a few&mdash;it had, as delivered by her, the one pre-eminent
merit of seeming like truth.&nbsp; A modern critic has well observed
of De Foe that he had the most amazing talent on record for telling
lies; and Ethelberta, in wishing her fiction to appear like a real narrative
of personal adventure, did wisely to make De Foe her model.&nbsp; His
is a style even better adapted for speaking than for writing, and the
peculiarities of diction which he adopts to give verisimilitude to his
narratives acquired enormous additional force when exhibited as viva-voce
mannerisms.&nbsp; And although these artifices were not, perhaps, slavishly
copied from that master of feigning, they would undoubtedly have reminded
her hearers of him, had they not mostly been drawn from an easeful section
in society which is especially characterized by the mental condition
of knowing nothing about any author a week after they have read him.&nbsp;
The few there who did remember De Foe were impressed by a fancy that
his words greeted them anew in a winged auricular form, instead of by
the weaker channels of print and eyesight.&nbsp; The reader may imagine
what an effect this well-studied method must have produced when intensified
by a clear, living voice, animated action, and the brilliant and expressive
eye of a handsome woman&mdash;attributes which of themselves almost
compelled belief.&nbsp; When she reached the most telling passages,
instead of adding exaggerated action and sound, Ethelberta would lapse
to a whisper and a sustained stillness, which were more striking than
gesticulation.&nbsp; All that could be done by art was there, and if
inspiration was wanting nobody missed it.</p>
<p>It was in performing this feat that Ethelberta seemed first to discover
in herself the full power of that self-command which further onward
in her career more and more impressed her as a singular possession,
until at last she was tempted to make of it many fantastic uses, leading
to results that affected more households than her own.&nbsp; A talent
for demureness under difficulties without the cold-bloodedness which
renders such a bearing natural and easy, a face and hand reigning unmoved
outside a heart by nature turbulent as a wave, is a constitutional arrangement
much to be desired by people in general; yet, had Ethelberta been framed
with less of that gift in her, her life might have been more comfortable
as an experience, and brighter as an example, though perhaps duller
as a story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladywell, how came this Mrs. Petherwin to think of such a
queer trick as telling romances, after doing so well as a poet?&rsquo;
said a man in the stalls to his friend, who had been gazing at the Story-teller
with a rapt face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?&mdash;everybody did, I thought,&rsquo;
said the painter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mistake.&nbsp; Indeed, I should not have come here at all
had I not heard the subject mentioned by accident yesterday at Grey&rsquo;s;
and then I remembered her to be the same woman I had met at some place&mdash;Belmaine&rsquo;s
I think it was&mdash;last year, when I thought her just getting on for
handsome and clever, not to put it too strongly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! naturally you would not know much,&rsquo; replied Ladywell,
in an eager whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I am judging others by myself
a little more than&mdash;but, as you have heard, she is an acquaintance
of mine.&nbsp; I know her very well, and, in fact, I originally suggested
the scheme to her as a pleasant way of adding to her fame.&nbsp; &ldquo;Depend
upon it, dear Mrs. Petherwin,&rdquo; I said, during a pause in one of
our dances together some time ago, &ldquo;any public appearance of yours
would be successful beyond description.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I had no idea that you knew her so well!&nbsp; Then it
is quite through you that she has adopted this course?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, not entirely&mdash;I could not say entirely.&nbsp; She
said that some day, perhaps, she might do such a thing; and, in short,
I reduced her vague ideas to form.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not mind knowing her better&mdash;I must get you
to throw us together in some way,&rsquo; said Neigh, with some interest.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had no idea that you were such an old friend.&nbsp; You could
do it, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, I am afraid&mdash;hah-hah&mdash;may not have the opportunity
of obliging you.&nbsp; I met her at Wyndway, you know, where she was
visiting with Lady Petherwin.&nbsp; It was some time ago, and I cannot
say that I have ever met her since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or before?&rsquo; said Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;no; I never did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladywell, if I had half your power of going to your imagination
for facts, I would be the greatest painter in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Neigh&mdash;that&rsquo;s too bad&mdash;but with regard
to this matter, I do speak with some interest,&rsquo; said Ladywell,
with a pleased sense of himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In love with her?&mdash;Smitten down?&mdash;Done for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, now!&nbsp; However, several other fellows chaff me about
her.&nbsp; It was only yesterday that Jones said&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know why she cares to do this sort of thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merely a desire for fame, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think she has fame enough already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I can express no opinion upon.&nbsp; I am thinking of
getting her permission to use her face in a subject I am preparing.&nbsp;
It is a fine face for canvas.&nbsp; Glorious contour&mdash;glorious.&nbsp;
Ah, here she is again, for the second part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dream on, young fellow.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll make a rare couple!&rsquo;
said Neigh, with a flavour of superciliousness unheeded by his occupied
companion.</p>
<p>Further back in the room were a pair of faces whose keen interest
in the performance contrasted much with the languidly permissive air
of those in front.&nbsp; When the ten minutes&rsquo; break occurred,
Christopher was the first of the two to speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, what
do you think of her, Faith?&rsquo; he said, shifting restlessly on his
seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like the quiet parts of the tale best, I think,&rsquo; replied
the sister; &lsquo;but, of course, I am not a good judge of these things.&nbsp;
How still the people are at times!&nbsp; I continually take my eyes
from her to look at the listeners.&nbsp; Did you notice the fat old
lady in the second row, with her cloak a little thrown back?&nbsp; She
was absolutely unconscious, and stayed with her face up and lips parted
like a little child of six.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She well may! the thing is a triumph.&nbsp; That fellow Ladywell
is here, I believe&mdash;yes, it is he, busily talking to the man on
his right.&nbsp; If I were a woman I would rather go donkey-driving
than stick myself up there, for gaping fops to quiz and say what they
like about!&nbsp; But she had no choice, poor thing; for it was that
or nothing with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith, who had secret doubts about the absolute necessity of Ethelberta&rsquo;s
appearance in public, said, with remote meanings, &lsquo;Perhaps it
is not altogether a severe punishment to her to be looked at by well-dressed
men.&nbsp; Suppose she feels it as a blessing, instead of an affliction?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a different sort of woman, Faith, and so you would
say if you knew her.&nbsp; Of course, it is natural for you to criticize
her severely just now, and I don&rsquo;t wish to defend her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you do a little, Kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I am indifferent about it all.&nbsp; Perhaps it would
have been better for me if I had never seen her; and possibly it might
have been better for her if she had never seen me.&nbsp; She has a heart,
and the heart is a troublesome encumbrance when great things have to
be done.&nbsp; I wish you knew her: I am sure you would like each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Faith, in a voice of rather weak conviction.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But, as we live in such a plain way, it would be hardly desirable
at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ethelberta being regarded, in common with the latest conjurer, spirit-medium,
aeronaut, giant, dwarf or monarch, as a new sensation, she was duly
criticized in the morning papers, and even obtained a notice in some
of the weekly reviews.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A handsome woman,&rsquo; said one of these, &lsquo;may have
her own reasons for causing the flesh of the London public to creep
upon its bones by her undoubtedly remarkable narrative powers; but we
question if much good can result from such a form of entertainment.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, some praise is due.&nbsp; We have had the novel-writer
among us for some time, and the novel-reader has occasionally appeared
on our platforms; but we believe that this is the first instance on
record of a Novel-teller&mdash;one, that is to say, who relates professedly
as fiction a romantic tale which has never been printed&mdash;the whole
owing its chief interest to the method whereby the teller identifies
herself with the leading character in the story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another observed: &lsquo;When once we get away from the magic influence
of the story-teller&rsquo;s eye and tongue, we perceive how improbable,
even impossible, is the tissue of events to which we have been listening
with so great a sense of reality, and we feel almost angry with ourselves
at having been the victims of such utter illusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s personal appearance is decidedly in
her favour,&rsquo; said another.&nbsp; &lsquo;She affects no unconsciousness
of the fact that form and feature are no mean vehicles of persuasion,
and she uses the powers of each to the utmost.&nbsp; There spreads upon
her face when in repose an air of innocence which is charmingly belied
by the subtlety we discover beneath it when she begins her tale; and
this amusing discrepancy between her physical presentment and the inner
woman is further illustrated by the misgiving, which seizes us on her
entrance, that so impressionable a lady will never bear up in the face
of so trying an audience. . . .&nbsp; The combinations of incident which
Mrs. Petherwin persuades her hearers that she has passed through are
not a little marvellous; and if what is rumoured be true, that the tales
are to a great extent based upon her own experiences, she has proved
herself to be no less daring in adventure than facile in her power of
describing it.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>17. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>After such successes as these, Christopher could not forego the seductive
intention of calling upon the poetess and romancer, at her now established
town residence in Exonbury Crescent.&nbsp; One wintry afternoon he reached
the door&mdash;now for the third time&mdash;and gave a knock which had
in it every tender refinement that could be thrown into the somewhat
antagonistic vehicle of noise.&nbsp; Turning his face down the street
he waited restlessly on the step.&nbsp; There was a strange light in
the atmosphere: the glass of the street-lamps, the varnished back of
a passing cab, a milk-woman&rsquo;s cans, and a row of church-windows
glared in his eyes like new-rubbed copper; and on looking the other
way he beheld a bloody sun hanging among the chimneys at the upper end,
as a danger-lamp to warn him off.</p>
<p>By this time the door was opened, and before him stood Ethelberta&rsquo;s
young brother Joey, thickly populated with little buttons, the remainder
of him consisting of invisible green.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Joseph,&rsquo; said Christopher, instantly recognizing
the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, are you here in office?&nbsp; Is your&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey lifted his forefinger and spread his mouth in a genial manner,
as if to signify particular friendliness mingled with general caution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, Mrs. Petherwin is my mistress.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
see if she is at home, sir,&rsquo; he replied, raising his shoulders
and winking a wink of strategic meanings by way of finish&mdash;all
which signs showed, if evidence were wanted, how effectually this pleasant
young page understood, though quite fresh from Wessex, the duties of
his peculiar position.&nbsp; Mr. Julian was shown to the drawing-room,
and there he found Ethelberta alone.</p>
<p>She gave him a hand so cool and still that Christopher, much as he
desired the contact, was literally ashamed to let her see and feel his
own, trembling with unmanageable excess of feeling.&nbsp; It was always
so, always had been so, always would be so, at these meetings of theirs:
she was immeasurably the strongest; and the deep-eyed young man fancied,
in the chagrin which the perception of this difference always bred in
him, that she triumphed in her superior control.&nbsp; Yet it was only
in little things that their sexes were thus reversed: Christopher would
receive quite a shock if a little dog barked at his heels, and be totally
unmoved when in danger of his life.</p>
<p>Certainly the most self-possessed woman in the world, under pressure
of the incongruity between their last meeting and the present one, might
have shown more embarrassment than Ethelberta showed on greeting him
to-day.&nbsp; Christopher was only a man in believing that the shyness
which she did evince was chiefly the result of personal interest.&nbsp;
She might or might not have been said to blush&mdash;perhaps the stealthy
change upon her face was too slow an operation to deserve that name:
but, though pale when he called, the end of ten minutes saw her colour
high and wide.&nbsp; She soon set him at his ease, and seemed to relax
a long-sustained tension as she talked to him of her arrangements, hopes,
and fears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how do you like London society?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty well, as far as I have seen it: to the surface of its
front door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find nothing to be alarmed at if you get inside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;of course not&mdash;except my own shortcomings,&rsquo;
said the modest musician.&nbsp; &lsquo;London society is made up of
much more refined people than society anywhere else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a very prevalent opinion; and it is nowhere half
so prevalent as in London society itself.&nbsp; However, come and see
my house&mdash;unless you think it a trouble to look over a house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I should like it very much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The decorations tended towards the artistic gymnastics prevalent
in some quarters at the present day.&nbsp; Upon a general flat tint
of duck&rsquo;s-egg green appeared quaint patterns of conventional foliage,
and birds, done in bright auburn, several shades nearer to redbreast-red
than was Ethelberta&rsquo;s hair, which was thus thrust further towards
brown by such juxtaposition&mdash;a possible reason for the choice of
tint.&nbsp; Upon the glazed tiles within the chimney-piece were the
forms of owls, bats, snakes, frogs, mice, spiders in their webs, moles,
and other objects of aversion and darkness, shaped in black and burnt
in after the approved fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brothers Sol and Dan did most of the actual work,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta, &lsquo;though I drew the outlines, and designed the
tiles round the fire.&nbsp; The flowers, mice, and spiders are done
very simply, you know: you only press a real flower, mouse, or spider
out flat under a piece of glass, and then copy it, adding a little more
emaciation and angularity at pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that &ldquo;at pleasure&rdquo; is where all the art lies,&rsquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes&mdash;that is the case,&rsquo; said Ethelberta thoughtfully;
and preceding him upstairs, she threw open a door on one of the floors,
disclosing Dan in person, engaged upon a similar treatment of this floor
also.&nbsp; Sol appeared bulging from the door of a closet, a little
further on, where he was fixing some shelves; and both wore workmen&rsquo;s
blouses.&nbsp; At once coming down from the short ladder he was standing
upon, Dan shook Christopher&rsquo;s hand with some velocity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We do a little at a time, you see,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;because
Colonel down below, and Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s visitors, shan&rsquo;t
smell the turpentine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We be pushing on to-day to get it out of the way,&rsquo; said
Sol, also coming forward and greeting their visitor, but more reluctantly
than his brother had done.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell ye what&mdash;you
two,&rsquo; he added, after an uneasy pause, turning from Christopher
to Ethelberta and back again in great earnestness; &lsquo;you&rsquo;d
better not bide here, talking to we rough ones, you know, for folks
might find out that there&rsquo;s something closer between us than workmen
and employer and employer&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; So Berta and Mr. Julian,
if you&rsquo;ll go on and take no more notice o&rsquo; us, in case of
visitors, it would be wiser&mdash;else, perhaps, if we should be found
out intimate with ye, and bring down your gentility, you&rsquo;ll blame
us for it.&nbsp; I get as nervous as a cat when I think I may be the
cause of any disgrace to ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly, Sol,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s all very well,&rsquo; said Sol, with an unbelieving
smile; &lsquo;but if we bain&rsquo;t company for you out of doors, you
bain&rsquo;t company for we within&mdash;not that I find fault with
ye or mind it, and shan&rsquo;t take anything for painting your house,
nor will Dan neither, any more for that&mdash;no, not a penny; in fact,
we are glad to do it for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; At the same time, you keep
to your class, and we&rsquo;ll keep to ours.&nbsp; And so, good afternoon,
Berta, when you like to go, and the same to you, Mr. Julian.&nbsp; Dan,
is that your mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can but own it,&rsquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>The two brothers then turned their backs upon their visitors, and
went on working, and Ethelberta and her lover left the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
brothers, you perceive,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;represent the respectable
British workman in his entirety, and a touchy individual he is, I assure
you, on points of dignity, after imbibing a few town ideas from his
leaders.&nbsp; They are painfully off-hand with me, absolutely refusing
to be intimate, from a mistaken notion that I am ashamed of their dress
and manners; which, of course, is absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which, of course, is absurd,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is absurd!&rsquo; she repeated with warmth, and
looking keenly at him.&nbsp; But, finding no harm in his face, she continued
as before: &lsquo;Yet, all the time, they will do anything under the
sun that they think will advance my interests.&nbsp; In our hearts we
are one.&nbsp; All they ask me to do is to leave them to themselves,
and therefore I do so.&nbsp; Now, would you like to see some more of
your acquaintance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She introduced him to a large attic; where he found himself in the
society of two or three persons considerably below the middle height,
whose manners were of that gushing kind sometimes called Continental,
their ages ranging from five years to eight.&nbsp; These were the youngest
children, presided over by Emmeline, as professor of letters, capital
and small.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am giving them the rudiments of education here,&rsquo; said
Ethelberta; &lsquo;but I foresee several difficulties in the way of
keeping them here, which I must get over as best I can.&nbsp; One trouble
is, that they don&rsquo;t get enough air and exercise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mrs. Chickerel living here as well?&rsquo; Christopher
ventured to inquire, when they were downstairs again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but confined to her room as usual, I regret to say.&nbsp;
Two more sisters of mine, whom you have never seen at all, are also
here.&nbsp; They are older than any of the rest of us, and had, broadly
speaking, no education at all, poor girls.&nbsp; The eldest, Gwendoline,
is my cook, and Cornelia is my housemaid.&nbsp; I suffer much sadness,
and almost misery sometimes, in reflecting that here are we, ten brothers
and sisters, born of one father and mother, who might have mixed together
and shared all in the same scenes, and been properly happy, if it were
not for the strange accidents that have split us up into sections as
you see, cutting me off from them without the compensation of joining
me to any others.&nbsp; They are all true as steel in keeping the secret
of our kin, certainly; but that brings little joy, though some satisfaction
perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might be less despondent, I think.&nbsp; The tale-telling
has been one of the successes of the season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I might; but I may observe that you scarcely set the
example of blitheness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;that&rsquo;s not because I don&rsquo;t recognize
the pleasure of being here.&nbsp; It is from a more general cause: simply
an underfeeling I have that at the most propitious moment the distance
to the possibility of sorrow is so short that a man&rsquo;s spirits
must not rise higher than mere cheerfulness out of bare respect to his
insight.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;As long as skies are blue, and
fields are green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,<br />
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ethelberta bowed uncertainly; the remark might refer to her past
conduct or it might not.&nbsp; &lsquo;My great cause of uneasiness is
the children,&rsquo; she presently said, as a new page of matter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is my duty, at all risk and all sacrifice of sentiment, to
educate and provide for them.&nbsp; The grown-up ones, older than myself,
I cannot help much, but the little ones I can.&nbsp; I keep my two French
lodgers for the sake of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lodgers, of course, don&rsquo;t know the relationship
between yourself and the rest of the people in the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&mdash;nor will they ever.&nbsp; My mother is supposed
to let the ground and first floors to me&mdash;a strange lady&mdash;as
she does the second and third floors to them.&nbsp; Still, I may be
discovered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;if you are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me be.&nbsp; Life is a battle, they say; but it is only
so in the sense that a game of chess is a battle&mdash;there is no seriousness
in it; it may be put an end to at any inconvenient moment by owning
yourself beaten, with a careless &ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo; and sweeping your
pieces into the box.&nbsp; Experimentally, I care to succeed in society;
but at the bottom of my heart, I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For that very reason you are likely to do it.&nbsp; My idea
is, make ambition your business and indifference your relaxation, and
you will fail; but make indifference your business and ambition your
relaxation, and you will succeed.&nbsp; So impish are the ways of the
gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope that you at any rate will succeed,&rsquo; she said,
at the end of a silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never can&mdash;if success means getting what one wants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you not get that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been forbidden to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her complexion changed just enough to show that she knew what he
meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you were as bold as you are subtle, you would
take a more cheerful view of the matter,&rsquo; she said, with a look
signifying innermost things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will instantly!&nbsp; Shall I test the truth of my cheerful
view by a word of question?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I deny that you are capable of taking that view, and until
you prove that you are, no question is allowed,&rsquo; she said, laughing,
and still warmer in the face and neck.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing but melancholy,
gentle melancholy, now as in old times when there was nothing to cause
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;you only tease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not throw aside that bitter medicine of distrust,
for the world.&nbsp; You have grown so used to it, that you take it
as food, as some invalids do their mixtures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ethelberta, you have my heart&mdash;my whole heart.&nbsp;
You have had it ever since I first saw you.&nbsp; Now you understand
me, and no pretending that you don&rsquo;t, mind, this second time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understood you long ago; you have not understood me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are mysterious,&rsquo; he said lightly; &lsquo;and perhaps
if I disentangle your mystery I shall find it to cover&mdash;indifference.&nbsp;
I hope it does&mdash;for your sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you say so!&rsquo; she exclaimed reproachfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet I wish it did too&mdash;I wish it did cover indifference&mdash;for
yours.&nbsp; But you have all of me that you care to have, and may keep
it for life if you wish to.&nbsp; Listen, surely there was a knock at
the door?&nbsp; Let us go inside the room: I am always uneasy when anybody
comes, lest any awkward discovery should be made by a visitor of my
miserable contrivances for keeping up the establishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey met them before they had left the landing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, Berta,&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;Mr. Ladywell has
called, and I&rsquo;ve showed him into the liberry.&nbsp; You know,
Berta, this is how it was, you know: I thought you and Mr. Julian were
in the drawing-room, and wouldn&rsquo;t want him to see ye together,
and so I asked him to step into the liberry a minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must improve your way of speaking,&rsquo; she said, with
quick embarrassment, whether at the mention of Ladywell&rsquo;s name
before Julian, or at the way Joey coupled herself with Christopher,
was quite uncertain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you excuse me for a few moments?&rsquo;
she said, turning to Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray sit down; I shall
not be long.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she glided downstairs.</p>
<p>They had been standing just by the drawing-room door, and Christopher
turned back into the room with no very satisfactory countenance.&nbsp;
It was very odd, he thought, that she should go down to Ladywell in
that mysterious manner, when he might have been admitted to where they
were talking without any trouble at all.&nbsp; What could Ladywell have
to say, as an acquaintance calling upon her for a few minutes, that
he was not to hear?&nbsp; Indeed, if it came to that, what right had
Ladywell to call upon her at all, even though she were a widow, and
to some extent chartered to live in a way which might be considered
a trifle free if indulged in by other young women.&nbsp; This was the
first time that he himself had ventured into her house on that very
account&mdash;a doubt whether it was quite proper to call, considering
her youth, and the fertility of her position as ground for scandal.&nbsp;
But no sooner did he arrive than here was Ladywell blundering in, and,
since this conjunction had occurred on his first visit, the chances
were that Ladywell came very often.</p>
<p>Julian walked up and down the room, every moment expanding itself
to a minute in his impatience at the delay and vexation at the cause.&nbsp;
After scrutinizing for the fifth time every object on the walls as if
afflicted with microscopic closeness of sight, his hands under his coat-tails,
and his person jigging up and down upon his toes, he heard her coming
up the stairs.&nbsp; When she entered the apartment her appearance was
decidedly that of a person subsiding after some little excitement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not calculate upon being so long,&rsquo; she said sweetly,
at the same time throwing back her face and smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I&mdash;was longer than I expected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seemed rather long,&rsquo; said Christopher gloomily, &lsquo;but
I don&rsquo;t mind it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad of that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you asked me to stay, I was very pleased to do so, and
always should be; but I think that now I will wish you good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not vexed with me?&rsquo; she said, looking quite
into his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Ladywell is nobody, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he is not much, I mean.&nbsp; The case is, that I am
sitting to him for a subject in which my face is to be used&mdash;otherwise
than as a portrait&mdash;and he called about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I say,&rsquo; said Christopher, &lsquo;that if you want
yourself painted, you are ill-advised not to let it be done by a man
who knows how to use the brush a little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he can paint!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, rather warmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His last picture was excellent, I think.&nbsp; It was greatly
talked about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagined you to say that he was a mere nobody!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;how provoking you are!&mdash;nobody, I mean,
to talk to.&nbsp; He is a true artist, nevertheless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher made no reply.&nbsp; The warm understanding between them
had quite ended now, and there was no fanning it up again.&nbsp; Sudden
tiffs had been the constant misfortune of their courtship in days gone
by, had been the remote cause of her marriage to another; and the familiar
shadows seemed to be rising again to cloud them with the same persistency
as ever.&nbsp; Christopher went downstairs with well-behaved moodiness,
and left the house forthwith.&nbsp; The postman came to the door at
the same time.</p>
<p>Ethelberta opened a letter from Picotee&mdash;now at Sandbourne again;
and, stooping to the fire-light, she began to read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,&mdash;I have tried to like
staying at Sandbourne because you wished it, but I can&rsquo;t endure
the town at all, dear Berta; everything is so wretched and dull!&nbsp;
O, I only wish you knew how dismal it is here, and how much I would
give to come to London!&nbsp; I cannot help thinking that I could do
better in town.&nbsp; You see, I should be close to you, and should
have the benefit of your experience.&nbsp; I would not mind what I did
for a living could I be there where you all are.&nbsp; It is so like
banishment to be here.&nbsp; If I could not get a pupil-teachership
in some London school (and I believe I could by advertising) I could
stay with you, and be governess to Georgina and Myrtle, for I am sure
you cannot spare time enough to teach them as they ought to be taught,
and Emmeline is not old enough to have any command over them.&nbsp;
I could also assist at your dressmaking, and you must require a great
deal of that to be done if you continue to appear in public.&nbsp; Mr.
Long read in the papers the account of your first evening, and afterwards
I heard two ladies of our committee talking about it; but of course
not one of them knew my personal interest in the discussion.&nbsp; Now
will you, Ethelberta, think if I may not come: Do, there&rsquo;s a dear
sister!&nbsp; I will do anything you set me about if I may only come.&mdash;Your
ever affectionate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PICOTEE.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Great powers above&mdash;what worries do beset me!&rsquo;
cried Ethelberta, jumping up.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can possess the child
so suddenly?&mdash;she used to like Sandbourne well enough!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She sat down, and hastily scribbled the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR PICOTEE&mdash;There is only a little time
to spare before the post goes, but I will try to answer your letter
at once.&nbsp; Whatever is the reason of this extraordinary dislike
to Sandbourne?&nbsp; It is a nice healthy place, and you are likely
to do much better than either of our elder sisters, if you follow straight
on in the path you have chosen.&nbsp; Of course, if such good fortune
should attend me that I get rich by my contrivances of public story-telling
and so on, I shall share everything with you and the rest of us, in
which case you shall not work at all.&nbsp; But (although I have been
unexpectedly successful so far) this is problematical; and it would
be rash to calculate upon all of us being able to live, or even us seven
girls only, upon the fortune I am going to make that way.&nbsp; So,
though I don&rsquo;t mean to be harsh, I must impress upon you the necessity
of going on as you are going just at present.&nbsp; I know the place
must be dull, but we must all put up with dulness sometimes.&nbsp; You,
being next to me in age, must aid me as well as you can in doing something
for the younger ones; and if anybody at all comes and lives here otherwise
than as a servant, it must be our father&mdash;who will not, however,
at present hear of such a thing when I mention it to him.&nbsp; Do think
of all this, Picotee, and bear up!&nbsp; Perhaps we shall all be happy
and united some day.&nbsp; Joey is waiting to run to the post-office
with this at once.&nbsp; All are well.&nbsp; Sol and Dan have nearly
finished the repairs and decorations of my house&mdash;but I will tell
you of that another time.&mdash;Your affectionate sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BERTA.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>18. NEAR SANDBOURNE&mdash;LONDON STREETS&mdash;ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S</h2>
<p>When this letter reached its destination the next morning, Picotee,
in her over-anxiety, could not bring herself to read it in anybody&rsquo;s
presence, and put it in her pocket till she was on her walk across the
moor.&nbsp; She still lived at the cottage out of the town, though at
some inconvenience to herself, in order to teach at a small village
night-school whilst still carrying on her larger occupation of pupil-teacher
in Sandbourne.</p>
<p>So she walked and read, and was soon in tears.&nbsp; Moreover, when
she thought of what Ethelberta would have replied had that keen sister
known the wildness of her true reason in wishing to go, she shuddered
with misery.&nbsp; To wish to get near a man only because he had been
kind to her, and had admired her pretty face, and had given her flowers,
to nourish a passion all the more because of its hopeless impracticability,
were things to dream of, not to tell.&nbsp; Picotee was quite an unreasoning
animal.&nbsp; Her sister arranged situations for her, told her how to
conduct herself in them, how to make up anew, in unobtrusive shapes,
the valuable wearing apparel she sent from time to time&mdash;so as
to provoke neither exasperation in the little gentry, nor superciliousness
in the great.&nbsp; Ethelberta did everything for her, in short; and
Picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind which people
show who have their thinking done for them, and put out their troubles
as they do their washing.&nbsp; She was quite willing not to be clever
herself, since it was unnecessary while she had a much-admired sister,
who was clever enough for two people and to spare.</p>
<p>This arrangement, by which she gained an untroubled existence in
exchange for freedom of will, had worked very pleasantly for Picotee
until the anomaly of falling in love on her own account created a jar
in the machinery.&nbsp; Then she began to know how wearing were miserable
days, and how much more wearing were miserable nights.&nbsp; She pictured
Christopher in London calling upon her dignified sister (for Ethelberta
innocently mentioned his name sometimes in writing) and imagined over
and over again the mutual signs of warm feeling between them.&nbsp;
And now Picotee resolved upon a noble course.&nbsp; Like Juliet, she
had been troubled with a consciousness that perhaps her love for Christopher
was a trifle forward and unmaidenly, even though she had determined
never to let him or anybody in the whole world know of it.&nbsp; To
set herself to pray that she might have strength to see him without
a pang the lover of her sister, who deserved him so much more than herself,
would be a grand penance and corrective.</p>
<p>After uttering petitions to this effect for several days, she still
felt very bad; indeed, in the psychological difficulty of striving for
what in her soul she did not desire, rather worse, if anything.&nbsp;
At last, weary of walking the old road and never meeting him, and blank
in a general powerlessness, she wrote the letter to Ethelberta, which
was only the last one of a series that had previously been written and
torn up.</p>
<p>Now this hope had been whirled away like thistledown, and the case
was grievous enough to distract a greater stoic than Picotee.&nbsp;
The end of it was that she left the school on insufficient notice, gave
up her cottage home on the plea&mdash;true in the letter&mdash;that
she was going to join a relative in London, and went off thither by
a morning train, leaving her things packed ready to be sent on when
she should write for them.</p>
<p>Picotee arrived in town late on a cold February afternoon, bearing
a small bag in her hand.&nbsp; She crossed Westminster Bridge on foot,
just after dusk, and saw a luminous haze hanging over each well-lighted
street as it withdrew into distance behind the nearer houses, showing
its direction as a train of morning mist shows the course of a distant
stream when the stream itself is hidden.&nbsp; The lights along the
riverside towards Charing Cross sent an inverted palisade of gleaming
swords down into the shaking water, and the pavement ticked to the touch
of pedestrians&rsquo; feet, most of whom tripped along as if walking
only to practise a favourite quick step, and held handkerchiefs to their
mouths to strain off the river mist from their lungs.&nbsp; She inquired
her way to Exonbury Crescent, and between five and six o&rsquo;clock
reached her sister&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes were passed in accumulating resolution sufficient
to ring the bell, which when at last she did, was not performed in a
way at all calculated to make the young man Joey hasten to the door.&nbsp;
After the lapse of a certain time he did, however, find leisure to stroll
and see what the caller might want, out of curiosity to know who there
could be in London afraid to ring a bell twice.</p>
<p>Joey&rsquo;s delight exceeded even his surprise, the ruling maxim
of his life being the more the merrier, under all circumstances.&nbsp;
The beaming young man was about to run off and announce her upstairs
and downstairs, left and right, when Picotee called him hastily to her.&nbsp;
In the hall her quick young eye had caught sight of an umbrella with
a peculiar horn handle&mdash;an umbrella she had been accustomed to
meet on Sandbourne Moor on many happy afternoons.&nbsp; Christopher
was evidently in the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joey,&rsquo; she said, as if she were ready to faint, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
tell Berta I am come.&nbsp; She has company, has she not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;only Mr. Julian!&rsquo; said the brother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s quite one of the family!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind&mdash;can&rsquo;t I go down into the kitchen with
you?&rsquo; she inquired.&nbsp; There had been bliss and misery mingled
in those tidings, and she scarcely knew for a moment which way they
affected her.&nbsp; What she did know was that she had run her dear
fox to earth, and a sense of satisfaction at that feat prevented her
just now from counting the cost of the performance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Mr. Julian come to see her very often?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s always a-coming&mdash;a regular bore
to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A regular what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bore!&mdash;Ah, I forgot, you don&rsquo;t know our town words.&nbsp;
However, come along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They passed by the doors on tiptoe, and their mother upstairs being,
according to Joey&rsquo;s account, in the midst of a nap, Picotee was
unwilling to disturb her; so they went down at once to the kitchen,
when forward rushed Gwendoline the cook, flourishing her floury hands,
and Cornelia the housemaid, dancing over her brush; and these having
welcomed and made Picotee comfortable, who should ring the area-bell,
and be admitted down the steps, but Sol and Dan.&nbsp; The workman-brothers,
their day&rsquo;s duties being over, had called to see their relations,
first, as usual, going home to their lodgings in Marylebone and making
themselves as spruce as bridegrooms, according to the rules of their
newly-acquired town experience.&nbsp; For the London mechanic is only
nine hours a mechanic, though the country mechanic works, eats, drinks,
and sleeps a mechanic throughout the whole twenty-four.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless my soul&mdash;Picotee!&rsquo; said Dan, standing
fixed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well&mdash;I say, this is splendid! ha-ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Picotee&mdash;what brought you here?&rsquo; said Sol, expanding
the circumference of his face in satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, come
along&mdash;never mind so long as you be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee explained circumstances as well as she could without stating
them, and, after a general conversation of a few minutes, Sol interrupted
with&mdash;&lsquo;Anybody upstairs with Mrs. Petherwin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Julian was there just now,&rsquo; said Joey; &lsquo;but
he may be gone.&nbsp; Berta always lets him slip out how he can, the
form of ringing me up not being necessary with him.&nbsp; Wait a minute&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph vanished up the stairs; and, the question whether Christopher
were gone or not being an uninteresting one to the majority, the talking
went on upon other matters.&nbsp; When Joey crept down again a minute
later, Picotee was sitting aloof and silent, and he accordingly singled
her out to speak to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a lark, Picotee!&rsquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Berta&rsquo;s
a-courting of her young man.&nbsp; Would you like to see how they carries
on a bit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dearly I should!&rsquo; said Picotee, the pupils of her eyes
dilating.</p>
<p>Joey conducted her to the top of the basement stairs, and told her
to listen.&nbsp; Within a few yards of them was the morning-room door,
now standing ajar; and an intermittent flirtation in soft male and female
tones could be heard going on inside.&nbsp; Picotee&rsquo;s lips parted
at thus learning the condition of things, and she leant against the
stair-newel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Joey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If this is London, I don&rsquo;t like it at all!&rsquo; moaned
Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I never see such a girl&mdash;fainting all over
the stairs for nothing in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;it will soon be gone&mdash;it is&mdash;it is only
indigestion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indigestion?&nbsp; Much you simple country people can know
about that!&nbsp; You should see what devils of indigestions we get
in high life&mdash;eating &rsquo;normous great dinners and suppers that
require clever physicians to carry &rsquo;em off, or else they&rsquo;d
carry us off with gout next day; and waking in the morning with such
a splitting headache, and dry throat, and inward cusses about human
nature, that you feel all the world like some great lord.&nbsp; However,
now let&rsquo;s go down again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; said the unhappy maiden imploringly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hark!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They listened again.&nbsp; The voices of the musician and poetess
had changed: there was a decided frigidity in their tone&mdash;then
came a louder expression&mdash;then a silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afeard,&rsquo; said Joey.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
won&rsquo;t fight; bless you, they busts out quarrelling like this times
and times when they&rsquo;ve been over-friendly, but it soon gets straight
with &rsquo;em again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was now a quick walk across the room, and Joey and his sister
drew down their heads out of sight.&nbsp; Then the room door was slammed,
quick footsteps went along the hall, the front door closed just as loudly,
and Christopher&rsquo;s tread passed into nothing along the pavement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather a wuss one than they mostly have; but
Lord, &rsquo;tis nothing at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t much like biding here listening!&rsquo; said
Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, &rsquo;tis how we do all over the West End,&rsquo; said
Joey.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis yer ignorance of town life that makes
it seem a good deal to &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t make much boast about town life; for you haven&rsquo;t
left off talking just as they do down in Wessex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I own to that&mdash;what&rsquo;s fair is fair, and &rsquo;tis
a true charge; but if I talk the Wessex way &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t for
want of knowing better; &rsquo;tis because my staunch nater makes me
bide faithful to our old ancient institutions.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d soon
own &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t ignorance in me, if you knowed what large quantities
of noblemen I gets mixed up with every day.&nbsp; In fact &rsquo;tis
thoughted here and there that I shall do very well in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let us go down,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything
seems so overpowering here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you&rsquo;ll get broke in soon enough.&nbsp; I felt just
the same when I first entered into society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think Berta will be angry with me?&nbsp; How does she
treat you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t complain.&nbsp; You see she&rsquo;s my
own flesh and blood, and what can I say?&nbsp; But, in secret truth,
the wages is terrible low, and barely pays for the tobacco I consooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Joey, you wicked boy!&nbsp; If mother only knew that you
smoked!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the wickedness so much as the smell.&nbsp;
And Mrs. Petherwin has got such a nose for a fellow&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis one of the greatest knots in service&mdash;the smoke question.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis thoughted that we shall make a great stir about it in the
mansions of the nobility soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much more you know of life than I do&mdash;you only fourteen
and me seventeen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; You see, age is nothing&mdash;&rsquo;tis
opportunity.&nbsp; And even I can&rsquo;t boast, for many a younger
man knows more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t smoke, Joey&mdash;there&rsquo;s a dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can I do?&nbsp; Society hev its rules, and if a person
wishes to keep himself up, he must do as the world do.&nbsp; We be all
Fashion&rsquo;s slave&mdash;as much a slave as the meanest in the land!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They got downstairs again; and when the dinner of the French lady
and gentleman had been sent up and cleared away, and also Ethelberta&rsquo;s
evening tea (which she formed into a genuine meal, making a dinner of
luncheon, when nobody was there, to give less trouble to her servant-sisters),
they all sat round the fire.&nbsp; Then the rustle of a dress was heard
on the staircase, and squirrel-haired Ethelberta appeared in person.&nbsp;
It was her custom thus to come down every spare evening, to teach Joey
and her sisters something or other&mdash;mostly French, which she spoke
fluently; but the cook and housemaid showed more ambition than intelligence
in acquiring that tongue, though Joey learnt it readily enough.</p>
<p>There was consternation in the camp for a moment or two, on account
of poor Picotee, Ethelberta being not without firmness in matters of
discipline.&nbsp; Her eye instantly lighted upon her disobedient sister,
now looking twice as disobedient as she really was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you are here, Picotee?&nbsp; I am glad to see you,&rsquo;
said the mistress of the house quietly.</p>
<p>This was altogether to Picotee&rsquo;s surprise, for she had expected
a round rating at least, in her freshness hardly being aware that this
reserve of feeling was an acquired habit of Ethelberta&rsquo;s, and
that civility stood in town for as much vexation as a tantrum represented
in Wessex.</p>
<p>Picotee lamely explained her outward reasons for coming, and soon
began to find that Ethelberta&rsquo;s opinions on the matter would not
be known by the tones of her voice.&nbsp; But innocent Picotee was as
wily as a religionist in sly elusions of the letter whilst infringing
the spirit of a dictum; and by talking very softly and earnestly about
the wondrous good she could do by remaining in the house as governess
to the children, and playing the part of lady&rsquo;s-maid to her sister
at show times, she so far coaxed Ethelberta out of her intentions that
she almost accepted the plan as a good one.&nbsp; It was agreed that
for the present, at any rate, Picotee should remain.&nbsp; Then a visit
was made to Mrs. Chickerel&rsquo;s room, where the remainder of the
evening was passed; and harmony reigned in the household.</p>
<h2>19. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S DRAWING-ROOM</h2>
<p>Picotee&rsquo;s heart was fitfully glad.&nbsp; She was near the man
who had enlarged her capacity from girl&rsquo;s to woman&rsquo;s, a
little note or two of young feeling to a whole diapason; and though
nearness was perhaps not in itself a great reason for felicity when
viewed beside the complete realization of all that a woman can desire
in such circumstances, it was much in comparison with the outer darkness
of the previous time.</p>
<p>It became evident to all the family that some misunderstanding had
arisen between Ethelberta and Mr. Julian.&nbsp; What Picotee hoped in
the centre of her heart as to the issue of the affair it would be too
complex a thing to say.&nbsp; If Christopher became cold towards her
sister he would not come to the house; if he continued to come it would
really be as Ethelberta&rsquo;s lover&mdash;altogether, a pretty game
of perpetual check for Picotee.</p>
<p>He did not make his appearance for several days.&nbsp; Picotee, being
a presentable girl, and decidedly finer-natured than her sisters below
stairs, was allowed to sit occasionally with Ethelberta in the afternoon,
when the teaching of the little ones had been done for the day; and
thus she had an opportunity of observing Ethelberta&rsquo;s emotional
condition with reference to Christopher, which Picotee did with an interest
that the elder sister was very far from suspecting.</p>
<p>At first Ethelberta seemed blithe enough without him.&nbsp; One more
day went, and he did not come, and then her manner was that of apathy.&nbsp;
Another day passed, and from fanciful elevations of the eyebrow, and
long breathings, it became apparent that Ethelberta had decidedly passed
the indifferent stage, and was getting seriously out of sorts about
him.&nbsp; Next morning she looked all hope.&nbsp; He did not come that
day either, and Ethelberta began to look pale with fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go out?&rsquo; said Picotee timidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly tell: I have been expecting some one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When she comes I must run up to mother at once, must I not?&rsquo;
said clever Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not a lady,&rsquo; said Ethelberta blandly.&nbsp; She
came then and stood by Picotee, and looked musingly out of the window.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I may as well tell you, perhaps,&rsquo; she continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is Mr. Julian.&nbsp; He is&mdash;I suppose&mdash;my lover,
in plain English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom I am not going to marry until he gets rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;how strange!&nbsp; If I had him&mdash;such a lover,
I mean&mdash;I would marry him if he continued poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it, Picotee; just as you come to London
without caring about consequences, or would do any other crazy thing
and not mind in the least what came of it.&nbsp; But somebody in the
family must take a practical view of affairs, or we should all go to
the dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee recovered from the snubbing which she felt that she deserved,
and charged gallantly by saying, with delicate showings of indifference,
&lsquo;Do you love this Mr. What&rsquo;s-his-name of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Julian?&nbsp; O, he&rsquo;s a very gentlemanly man.&nbsp;
That is, except when he is rude, and ill-uses me, and will not come
and apologize!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I had him&mdash;a lover, I would ask him to come if I wanted
him to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta did not give her mind to this remark; but, drawing a long
breath, said, with a pouting laugh, which presaged unreality, &lsquo;The
idea of his getting indifferent now!&nbsp; I have been intending to
keep him on until I got tired of his attentions, and then put an end
to them by marrying him; but here is he, before he has hardly declared
himself, forgetting my existence as much as if he had vowed to love
and cherish me for life.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an unnatural inversion of
the manners of society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you first get to care for him, dear Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;when I had seen him once or twice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goodness&mdash;how quick you were!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;if I am in the mind for loving I am not to be hindered
by shortness of acquaintanceship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I neither!&rsquo; sighed Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor any other woman.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t need to know a man
well in order to love him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s only necessary when we
want to leave off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Berta&mdash;you don&rsquo;t believe that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a woman did not invariably form an opinion of her choice
before she has half seen him, and love him before she has half formed
an opinion, there would be no tears and pining in the whole feminine
world, and poets would starve for want of a topic.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe it, do you say?&nbsp; Ah, well, we shall see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee did not know what to say to this; and Ethelberta left the
room to see about her duties as public story-teller, in which capacity
she had undertaken to appear again this very evening.</p>
<h2>20. THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE HALL&mdash;THE ROAD HOME</h2>
<p>London was illuminated by the broad full moon.&nbsp; The pavements
looked white as if mantled with snow; ordinary houses were sublimated
to the rank of public buildings, public buildings to palaces, and the
faces of women walking the streets to those of calendared saints and
guardian-angels, by the pure bleaching light from the sky.</p>
<p>In the quiet little street where opened the private door of the Hall
chosen by Ethelberta for her story-telling, a brougham was waiting.&nbsp;
The time was about eleven o&rsquo;clock; and presently a lady came out
from the building, the moonbeams forthwith flooding her face, which
they showed to be that of the Story-teller herself.&nbsp; She hastened
across to the carriage, when a second thought arrested her motion: telling
the man-servant and a woman inside the brougham to wait for her, she
wrapped up her features and glided round to the front of the house,
where she paused to observe the carriages and cabs driving up to receive
the fashionable crowd stepping down from the doors.&nbsp; Standing here
in the throng which her own talent and ingenuity had drawn together,
she appeared to enjoy herself by listening for a minute or two to the
names of several persons of more or less distinction as they were called
out, and then regarded attentively the faces of others of lesser degree:
to scrutinize the latter was, as the event proved, the real object of
the journey from round the corner.&nbsp; When nearly every one had left
the doors, she turned back disappointed.&nbsp; Ethelberta had been fancying
that her alienated lover Christopher was in the back rows to-night,
but, as far as could now be observed, the hopeful supposition was a
false one.</p>
<p>When she got round to the back again, a man came forward.&nbsp; It
was Ladywell, whom she had spoken to already that evening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Allow
me to bring you your note-book, Mrs. Petherwin: I think you had forgotten
it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I assure you that nobody has handled
it but myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta thanked him, and took the book.&nbsp; &lsquo;I use it
to look into between the parts, in case my memory should fail me,&rsquo;
she explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;I remember that I did lay it down, now you
remind me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ladywell had apparently more to say, and moved by her side towards
the carriage; but she declined the arm he offered, and said not another
word till he went on, haltingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your triumph to-night was very great, and it was as much a
triumph to me as to you; I cannot express my feeling&mdash;I cannot
say half that I would.&nbsp; If I might only&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you much,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, with dignity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you for bringing my book, but I must go home now.&nbsp;
I know that you will see that it is not necessary for us to be talking
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;you are quite right,&rsquo; said the repressed young
painter, struck by her seriousness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Blame me; I ought to
have known better.&nbsp; But perhaps a man&mdash;well, I will say it&mdash;a
lover without indiscretion is no lover at all.&nbsp; Circumspection
and devotion are a contradiction in terms.&nbsp; I saw that, and hoped
that I might speak without real harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You calculated how to be uncalculating, and are natural by
art!&rsquo; she said, with the slightest accent of sarcasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
pray do not attend me further&mdash;it is not at all necessary or desirable.&nbsp;
My maid is in the carriage.&rsquo;&nbsp; She bowed, turned, and entered
the vehicle, seating herself beside Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was harsh!&rsquo; said Ladywell to himself, as he looked
after the retreating carriage.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was a fool; but it was
harsh.&nbsp; Yet what man on earth likes a woman to show too great a
readiness at first?&nbsp; She is right: she would be nothing without
repulse!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he moved away in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What man was that?&rsquo; said Picotee, as they drove along.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;a mere Mr. Ladywell: a painter of good family, to
whom I have been sitting for what he calls an Idealization.&nbsp; He
is a dreadful simpleton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you choose him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not: he chose me.&nbsp; But his silliness of behaviour
is a hopeful sign for the picture.&nbsp; I have seldom known a man cunning
with his brush who was not simple with his tongue; or, indeed, any skill
in particular that was not allied to general stupidity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your own skill is not like that, is it, Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In men&mdash;in men.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean in women.&nbsp;
How childish you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The slight depression at finding that Christopher was not present,
which had followed Ethelberta&rsquo;s public triumph that evening, was
covered over, if not removed, by Ladywell&rsquo;s declaration, and she
reached home serene in spirit.&nbsp; That she had not the slightest
notion of accepting the impulsive painter made little difference; a
lover&rsquo;s arguments being apt to affect a lady&rsquo;s mood as much
by measure as by weight.&nbsp; A useless declaration like a rare china
teacup with a hole in it, has its ornamental value in enlarging a collection.</p>
<p>No sooner had they entered the house than Mr. Julian&rsquo;s card
was discovered; and Joey informed them that he had come particularly
to speak with Ethelberta, quite forgetting that it was her evening for
tale-telling.</p>
<p>This was real delight, for between her excitements Ethelberta had
been seriously sick-hearted at the horrible possibility of his never
calling again.&nbsp; But alas! for Christopher.&nbsp; There being nothing
like a dead silence for getting one&rsquo;s off-hand sweetheart into
a corner, there is nothing like prematurely ending it for getting into
that corner one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now won&rsquo;t I punish him for daring to stay away so long!&rsquo;
she exclaimed as soon as she got upstairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is as bad
to show constancy in your manners as fickleness in your heart at such
a time as this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I thought honesty was the best policy?&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is, for the man&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
you go believing in sayings, Picotee: they are all made by men, for
their own advantages.&nbsp; Women who use public proverbs as a guide
through events are those who have not ingenuity enough to make private
ones as each event occurs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sat down, and rapidly wrote a line to Mr. Julian:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;EXONBURY CRESCENT.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I return from Mayfair Hall to find you have called.&nbsp;
You will, I know, be good enough to forgive my saying what seems an
unfriendly thing, when I assure you that the circumstances of my peculiar
situation make it desirable, if not necessary.&nbsp; It is that I beg
you not to give me the pleasure of a visit from you for some little
time, for unhappily the frequency of your kind calls has been noticed;
and I am now in fear that we may be talked about&mdash;invidiously&mdash;to
the injury of us both.&nbsp; The town, or a section of it, has turned
its bull&rsquo;s-eye upon me with a brightness which I did not in the
least anticipate; and you will, I am sure, perceive how indispensable
it is that I should be circumspect.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>E. PETHERWIN.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>21. A STREET&mdash;NEIGH&rsquo;S ROOMS&mdash;CHRISTOPHER&rsquo;S
ROOMS</h2>
<p>As soon as Ethelberta had driven off from the Hall, Ladywell turned
back again; and, passing the front entrance, overtook his acquaintance
Mr. Neigh, who had been one of the last to emerge.&nbsp; The two were
going in the same direction, and they walked a short distance together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anything serious happened?&rsquo; said Neigh, noticing
an abstraction in his companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem in
your usual mood to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is only that affair between us,&rsquo; said Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Affair?&nbsp; Between you and whom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her and myself, of course.&nbsp; It will be in every fellow&rsquo;s
mouth now, I suppose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;not anything between yourself and Mrs. Petherwin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mere nothing.&nbsp; But surely you started, Neigh, when
you suspected it just this moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;you merely fancied that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she not speak well to-night!&nbsp; You were in the room,
I believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I just turned in for half-an-hour: it seems that everybody
does, so I thought I must.&nbsp; But I had no idea that you were feeble
that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very kind of you, Neigh&mdash;upon my word it is&mdash;very
kind; and of course I appreciate the delicacy which&mdash;which&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s kind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean your well-intentioned plan for making me believe that
nothing is known of this.&nbsp; But stories will of course get wind;
and if our attachment has made more noise in the world than I intended
it should, and causes any public interest, why&mdash;ha-ha!&mdash;it
must.&nbsp; There is some little romance in it perhaps, and people will
talk of matters of that sort between individuals of any repute&mdash;little
as that is with one of the pair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course they will&mdash;of course.&nbsp; You are a rising
man, remember, whom some day the world will delight to honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for that, Neigh.&nbsp; Thank you sincerely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; It is merely justice to say it, and one
must he generous to deserve thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha!&mdash;that&rsquo;s very nicely put, and undeserved
I am sure.&nbsp; And yet I need a word of that sort sometimes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Genius is proverbially modest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t, Neigh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deserve it, indeed.&nbsp;
Of course it is well meant in you to recognize any slight powers, but
I don&rsquo;t deserve it.&nbsp; Certainly, my self-assurance was never
too great.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the misfortune of all children of art that
they should be so dependent upon any scraps of praise they can pick
up to help them along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when that child gets so deep in love that you can only
see the whites of his eyes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;now, Neigh&mdash;don&rsquo;t, I say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why did&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did I love her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, why did you love her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, if I could only turn self-vivisector, and watch the operation
of my heart, I should know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow, you must be very bad indeed to talk like that.&nbsp;
A poet himself couldn&rsquo;t be cleaner gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t chaff, Neigh; do anything, but don&rsquo;t
chaff.&nbsp; You know that I am the easiest man in the world for taking
it at most times.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t stand it now; I don&rsquo;t
feel up to it.&nbsp; A glimpse of paradise, and then perdition.&nbsp;
What would you do, Neigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has refused you, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;not positively refused me; but it is so near it
that a dull man couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference.&nbsp; I hardly can
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you really stand with her?&rsquo; said Neigh, with
an anxiety ill-concealed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Off and on&mdash;neither one thing nor the other.&nbsp; I
was determined to make an effort the last time she sat to me, and so
I met her quite coolly, and spoke only of technicalities with a forced
smile&mdash;you know that way of mine for drawing people out, eh, Neigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite, quite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A forced smile, as much as to say, &ldquo;I am obliged to
entertain you, but as a mere model for art purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the deuce a bit did she care.&nbsp; And then I frequently looked to
see what time it was, as the end of the sitting drew near&mdash;rather
a rude thing to do, as a rule.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; But that was your finesse.&nbsp; Ha-ha!&mdash;capital!&nbsp;
Yet why not struggle against such slavery?&nbsp; It is regularly pulling
you down.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s beauty, after all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well you may say so!&nbsp; A thing easier to feel than define,&rsquo;
murmured Ladywell.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s no use, Neigh&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t help it as long as she repulses me so exquisitely!&nbsp;
If she would only care for me a little, I might get to trouble less
about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And love her no more than one ordinarily does a girl by the
time one gets irrevocably engaged to her.&nbsp; But I suppose she keeps
you back so thoroughly that you carry on the old adoration with as much
vigour as if it were a new fancy every time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly yes, and partly no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very true, and
it&rsquo;s not true!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis to be hoped she won&rsquo;t hate you outright,
for then you would absolutely die of idolizing her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Neigh!&mdash;Still there&rsquo;s some truth in
it&mdash;such is the perversity of our hearts.&nbsp; Fancy marrying
such a woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We should feel as eternally united to her after years and
years of marriage as to a dear new angel met at last night&rsquo;s dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly&mdash;just what I should have said.&nbsp; But did
I hear you say &ldquo;We,&rdquo; Neigh?&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;WE
should feel?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say &ldquo;we&rdquo;?&mdash;yes&mdash;of course&mdash;putting
myself in your place just in the way of speaking, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, of course; but one is such a fool at these times
that one seems to detect rivalry in every trumpery sound!&nbsp; Were
you never a little touched?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I.&nbsp; My heart is in the happy position of a country
which has no history or debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I should rejoice to hear it,&rsquo; said Ladywell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But the consciousness of a fellow-sufferer being in just such
another hole is such a relief always, and softens the sense of one&rsquo;s
folly so very much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s less Christianity in that sentiment than in
your confessing to it, old fellow.&nbsp; I know the truth of it nevertheless,
and that&rsquo;s why married men advise others to marry.&nbsp; Were
all the world tied up, the pleasantly tied ones would be equivalent
to those at present free.&nbsp; But what if your fellow-sufferer is
not only in another such a hole, but in the same one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Neigh&mdash;never!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trifle with a friend
who&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is, refused like yourself, as well as in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, thanks, thanks!&nbsp; It suddenly occurred to me that
we might be dead against one another as rivals, and a friendship of
many long&mdash;days be snapped like a&mdash;like a reed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;only a jest,&rsquo; said Neigh, with a strangely
accelerated speech.&nbsp; &lsquo;Love-making is an ornamental pursuit
that matter-of-fact fellows like me are quite unfit for.&nbsp; A man
must have courted at least half-a-dozen women before he&rsquo;s a match
for one; and since triumph lies so far ahead, I shall keep out of the
contest altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your life would be pleasanter if you were engaged.&nbsp; It
is a nice thing, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is.&nbsp; The worst of it would be that, when the time
came for breaking it off, a fellow might get into an action for breach&mdash;women
are so fond of that sort of thing now; and I hate love-affairs that
don&rsquo;t end peaceably!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But end it by peaceably marrying, my dear fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would seem so singular.&nbsp; Besides, I have a horror
of antiquity: and you see, as long as a man keeps single, he belongs
in a measure to the rising generation, however old he may be; but as
soon as he marries and has children, he belongs to the last generation,
however young he may be.&nbsp; Old Jones&rsquo;s son is a deal younger
than young Brown&rsquo;s father, though they are both the same age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, honest courtship cures a man of many evils he
had no power to stem before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By substituting an incurable matrimony!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;two persons must have a mind for that before it can
happen!&rsquo; said Ladywell, sorrowfully shaking his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find that if one has a mind for it, it
will be quite sufficient.&nbsp; But here we are at my rooms.&nbsp; Come
in for half-an-hour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to-night, thanks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They parted, and Neigh went in.&nbsp; When he got upstairs he murmured
in his deepest chest note, &lsquo;O, lords, that I should come to this!&nbsp;
But I shall never be such a fool as to marry her!&nbsp; What a flat
that poor young devil was not to discover that we were tarred with the
same brush.&nbsp; O, the deuce, the deuce!&rsquo; he continued, walking
about the room as if passionately stamping, but not quite doing it because
another man had rooms below.</p>
<p>Neigh drew from his pocket-book an envelope embossed with the name
of a fashionable photographer, and out of this pulled a portrait of
the lady who had, in fact, enslaved his secret self equally with his
frank young friend the painter.&nbsp; After contemplating it awhile
with a face of cynical adoration, he murmured, shaking his head, &lsquo;Ah,
my lady; if you only knew this, I should be snapped up like a snail!&nbsp;
Not a minute&rsquo;s peace for me till I had married you.&nbsp; I wonder
if I shall!&mdash;I wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh was a man of five-and-thirty&mdash;Ladywell&rsquo;s senior
by ten years; and, being of a phlegmatic temperament, he had glided
thus far through the period of eligibility with impunity.&nbsp; He knew
as well as any man how far he could go with a woman and yet keep clear
of having to meet her in church without her bonnet; but it is doubtful
if his mind that night were less disturbed with the question how to
guide himself out of the natural course which his passion for Ethelberta
might tempt him into, than was Ladywell&rsquo;s by his ardent wish to
secure her.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>About the time at which Neigh and Ladywell parted company, Christopher
Julian was entering his little place in Bloomsbury.&nbsp; The quaint
figure of Faith, in her bonnet and cloak, was kneeling on the hearth-rug
endeavouring to stir a dull fire into a bright one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Faith! you have never been out alone?&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Faith&rsquo;s soft, quick-shutting eyes looked unutterable things,
and she replied, &lsquo;I have been to hear Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s story-telling
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And walked all the way home through the streets at this time
of night, I suppose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, nobody molested me, either going or coming back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, I gave you strict orders not to go into the streets
after two o&rsquo;clock in the day, and now here you are taking no notice
of what I say at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truth is, Kit, I wanted to see with my spectacles what
this woman was really like, and I went without them last time.&nbsp;
I slipped in behind, and nobody saw me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of her after what I have seen tonight,&rsquo;
said Christopher, moodily recurring to a previous thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why? What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I would call on her this afternoon, but when I got
there I found she had left early for the performance.&nbsp; So in the
evening, when I thought it would be all over, I went to the private
door of the Hall to speak to her as she came out, and ask her flatly
a question or two which I was fool enough to think I must ask her before
I went to bed.&nbsp; Just as I was drawing near she came out, and, instead
of getting into the brougham that was waiting for her, she went round
the corner.&nbsp; When she came back a man met her and gave her something,
and they stayed talking together two or three minutes.&nbsp; The meeting
may certainly not have been intentional on her part; but she has no
business to be going on so coolly when&mdash;when&mdash;in fact, I have
come to the conclusion that a woman&rsquo;s affection is not worth having.&nbsp;
The only feeling which has any dignity or permanence or worth is family
affection between close blood-relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet you snub me sometimes, Mr. Kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, for the matter of that, you snub me.&nbsp; Still, you
know what I mean&mdash;there&rsquo;s none of that off-and-on humbug
between us.&nbsp; If we grumble with one another we are united just
the same: if we don&rsquo;t write when we are parted, we are just the
same when we meet&mdash;there has been some rational reason for silence;
but as for lovers and sweethearts, there is nothing worth a rush in
what they feel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith said nothing in reply to this.&nbsp; The opinions she had formed
upon the wisdom of her brother&rsquo;s pursuit of Ethelberta would have
come just then with an ill grace.&nbsp; It must, however, have been
evident to Christopher, had he not been too preoccupied for observation,
that Faith&rsquo;s impressions of Ethelberta were not quite favourable
as regarded her womanhood, notwithstanding that she greatly admired
her talents.</p>
<h2>22. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>Ethelberta came indoors one day from the University boat-race, and
sat down, without speaking, beside Picotee, as if lost in thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you enjoy the sight?&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I scarcely know.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t see at all from Mrs.
Belmaine&rsquo;s carriage, so two of us&mdash;very rashly&mdash;agreed
to get out and be rowed across to the other side where the people were
quite few.&nbsp; But when the boatman had us in the middle of the river
he declared he couldn&rsquo;t land us on the other side because of the
barges, so there we were in a dreadful state&mdash;tossed up and down
like corks upon great waves made by steamers till I made up my mind
for a drowning.&nbsp; Well, at last we got back again, but couldn&rsquo;t
reach the carriage for the crowd; and I don&rsquo;t know what we should
have done if a gentleman hadn&rsquo;t come&mdash;sent by Mrs. Belmaine,
who was in a great fright about us; then he was introduced to me, and&mdash;I
wonder how it will end!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there anything so wonderful in the beginning, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; One of the coolest and most practised men in London
was ill-mannered towards me from sheer absence of mind&mdash;and could
there be higher flattery?&nbsp; When a man of that sort does not give
you the politeness you deserve, it means that in his heart he is rebelling
against another feeling which his pride suggests that you do not deserve.&nbsp;
O, I forgot to say that he is a Mr. Neigh, a nephew of Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s,
who lives at ease about Piccadilly and Pall Mall, and has a few acres
somewhere&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know much of him.&nbsp; The worst
of my position now is that I excite this superficial interest in many
people and a deep friendship in nobody.&nbsp; If what all my supporters
feel could be collected into the hearts of two or three they would love
me better than they love themselves; but now it pervades all and operates
in none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it must operate in this gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes&mdash;just for the present.&nbsp; But men in town
have so many contrivances for getting out of love that you can&rsquo;t
calculate upon keeping them in for two days together.&nbsp; However,
it is all the same to me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only&mdash;but let that
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is there only?&rsquo; said Picotee coaxingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one man,&rsquo; murmured Ethelberta, in much lower tones.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I mean, whose wife I should care to be; and the very qualities
I like in him will, I fear, prevent his ever being in a position to
ask me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he the man you punished the week before last by forbidding
him to come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he is: but he does not want civility from me.&nbsp;
Where there&rsquo;s much feeling there&rsquo;s little ceremony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It certainly seems that he does not want civility from you
to make him attentive to you,&rsquo; said Picotee, stifling a sigh;
&lsquo;for here is a letter in his handwriting, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have given it to me at once,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
opening the envelope hastily.&nbsp; It contained very few sentences:
they were to the effect that Christopher had received her letter forbidding
him to call; that he had therefore at first resolved not to call or
even see her more, since he had become such a shadow in her path.&nbsp;
Still, as it was always best to do nothing hastily, he had on second
thoughts decided to ask her to grant him a last special favour, and
see him again just once, for a few minutes only that afternoon, in which
he might at least say Farewell.&nbsp; To avoid all possibility of compromising
her in anybody&rsquo;s eyes, he would call at half-past six, when other
callers were likely to be gone, knowing that from the peculiar constitution
of the household the hour would not interfere with her arrangements.&nbsp;
There being no time for an answer, he would assume that she would see
him, and keep the engagement; the request being one which could not
rationally be objected to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;read it!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, with glad displeasure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did you ever hear such audacity?&nbsp; Fixing a time so soon
that I cannot reply, and thus making capital out of a pretended necessity,
when it is really an arbitrary arrangement of his own.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
real rebellion&mdash;forcing himself into my house when I said strictly
he was not to come; and then, that it cannot rationally be objected
to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like his &ldquo;rationally.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where there&rsquo;s much love there&rsquo;s little ceremony,
didn&rsquo;t you say just now?&rsquo; observed innocent Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where there&rsquo;s little love, no ceremony at all.&nbsp;
These manners of his are dreadful, and I believe he will never improve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes you care not a bit about him, does it not, Berta?&rsquo;
said Picotee hopefully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t answer for that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I feel, as many others do, that a want of ceremony which is produced
by abstraction of mind is no defect in a poet or musician, fatal as
it may be to an ordinary man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mighty me! You soon forgive him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Picotee, don&rsquo;t you be so quick to speak.&nbsp; Before
I have finished, how do you know what I am going to say?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
never tell you anything again, if you take me up so.&nbsp; Of course
I am going to punish him at once, and make him remember that I am a
lady, even if I do like him a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean to punish him?&rsquo; said Picotee, with interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By writing and telling him that on no account is he to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is not time for a letter&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; It will show him that I did
not <i>mean</i> him to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At hearing the very merciful nature of the punishment, Picotee sighed
without replying; and Ethelberta despatched her note.&nbsp; The hour
of appointment drew near, and Ethelberta showed symptoms of unrest.&nbsp;
Six o&rsquo;clock struck and passed.&nbsp; She walked here and there
for nothing, and it was plain that a dread was filling her: her letter
might accidentally have had, in addition to the moral effect which she
had intended, the practical effect which she did not intend, by arriving
before, instead of after, his purposed visit to her, thereby stopping
him in spite of all her care.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long are letters going to Bloomsbury?&rsquo; she said
suddenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two hours, Joey tells me,&rsquo; replied Picotee, who had
already inquired on her own private account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; exclaimed Ethelberta petulantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
I dislike a man to misrepresent things!&nbsp; He said there was not
time for a reply!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Picotee, in angel
tones; &lsquo;and so it happens all right, and he has got it, and he
will not come after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They waited and waited, but Christopher did not appear that night;
the true case being that his declaration about insufficient time for
a reply was merely an ingenious suggestion to her not to be so cruel
as to forbid him.&nbsp; He was far from suspecting when the letter of
denial did reach him&mdash;about an hour before the time of appointment&mdash;that
it was sent by a refinement of art, of which the real intention was
futility, and that but for his own misstatement it would have been carefully
delayed.</p>
<p>The next day another letter came from the musician, decidedly short
and to the point.&nbsp; The irate lover stated that he would not be
made a fool of any longer: under any circumstances he meant to come
that self-same afternoon, and should decidedly expect her to see him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not see him!&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why
did he not call last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you told him not to,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, as if a woman&rsquo;s words are to be translated
as literally as Homer!&nbsp; Surely he is aware that more often than
not &ldquo;No&rdquo; is said to a man&rsquo;s importunities because
it is traditionally the correct modest reply, and for nothing else in
the world.&nbsp; If all men took words as superficially as he does,
we should die of decorum in shoals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Berta! how could you write a letter that you did not mean
should be obeyed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did in a measure mean it, although I could have shown Christian
forgiveness if it had not been.&nbsp; Never mind; I will not see him.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll plague my heart for the credit of my sex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To ensure the fulfilment of this resolve, Ethelberta determined to
give way to a headache that she was beginning to be aware of, go to
her room, disorganize her dress, and ruin her hair by lying down; so
putting it out of her power to descend and meet Christopher on any momentary
impulse.</p>
<p>Picotee sat in the room with her, reading, or pretending to read,
and Ethelberta pretended to sleep.&nbsp; Christopher&rsquo;s knock came
up the stairs, and with it the end of the farce.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; said Ethelberta in the prompt
and broadly-awake tone of one who had been concentrated on the expectation
of that sound for a length of time, &lsquo;it was a mistake in me to
do this!&nbsp; Joey will be sure to make a muddle of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey was heard coming up the stairs.&nbsp; Picotee opened the door,
and said, with an anxiety transcending Ethelberta&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, will you tell Mrs. Petherwin that Mr. Julian says he&rsquo;ll
wait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were not to ask him to wait,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; said Joey, &lsquo;and I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s doing that out of his own head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let Mr. Julian wait, by all means,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Allow him to wait if he likes, but tell him it is uncertain if
I shall be able to come down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey then retired, and the two sisters remained in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; Ethelberta said, at the
end of a long time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were asleep,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall
we ask Joey?&nbsp; I have not heard the door close.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joey was summoned, and after a leisurely ascent, interspersed by
various gymnastic performances over the handrail here and there, appeared
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s there jest the same: he don&rsquo;t seem to be
in no hurry at all,&rsquo; said Joey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is he doing?&rsquo; inquired Picotee solicitously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, only looking at his watch sometimes, and humming tunes,
and playing rat-a-tat-tat upon the table.&nbsp; He says he don&rsquo;t
mind waiting a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have made a mistake in the message,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&nbsp; I am correct as a jineral thing.&nbsp; I jest
said perhaps you would be engaged all the evening, and perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Joey had again retired, and they had waited another ten minutes,
Ethelberta said, &lsquo;Picotee, do you go down and speak a few words
to him.&nbsp; I am determined he shall not see me.&nbsp; You know him
a little; you remember when he came to the Lodge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What must I say to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta paused before replying.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try to find out if&mdash;if
he is much grieved at not seeing me, and say&mdash;give him to understand
that I will forgive him, Picotee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Picotee&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he says he <i>must</i> see me&mdash;I think I will get
up.&nbsp; But only if he says <i>must</i>: you remember that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee departed on her errand.&nbsp; She paused on the staircase
trembling, and thinking between the thrills how very far would have
been the conduct of her poor slighted self from proud recalcitration
had Mr. Julian&rsquo;s gentle request been addressed to her instead
of to Ethelberta; and she went some way in the painful discovery of
how much more tantalizing it was to watch an envied situation that was
held by another than to be out of sight of it altogether.&nbsp; Here
was Christopher waiting to bestow love, and Ethelberta not going down
to receive it: a commodity unequalled in value by any other in the whole
wide world was being wantonly wasted within that very house.&nbsp; If
she could only have stood to-night as the beloved Ethelberta, and not
as the despised Picotee, how different would be this going down!&nbsp;
Thus she went along, red and pale moving in her cheeks as in the Northern
Lights at their strongest time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Christopher had sat waiting minute by minute till the evening
shades grew browner, and the fire sank low.&nbsp; Joey, finding himself
not particularly wanted upon the premises after the second inquiry,
had slipped out to witness a nigger performance round the corner, and
Julian began to think himself forgotten by all the household.&nbsp;
The perception gradually cooled his emotions and enabled him to hold
his hat quite steadily.</p>
<p>When Picotee gently thrust open the door she was surprised to find
the room in darkness, the fire gone completely out, and the form of
Christopher only visible by a faint patch of light, which, coming from
a lamp on the opposite side of the way and falling upon the mirror,
was thrown as a pale nebulosity upon his shoulder.&nbsp; Picotee was
too flurried at sight of the familiar outline to know what to do, and,
instead of going or calling for a light, she mechanically advanced into
the room.&nbsp; Christopher did not turn or move in any way, and then
she perceived that he had begun to doze in his chair.</p>
<p>Instantly, with the precipitancy of the timorous, she said, &lsquo;Mr.
Julian!&rsquo; and touched him on the shoulder&mdash;murmuring then,
&lsquo;O, I beg pardon, I&mdash;I will get a light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher&rsquo;s consciousness returned, and his first act, before
rising, was to exclaim, in a confused manner, &lsquo;Ah&mdash;you have
come&mdash;thank you, Berta!&rsquo; then impulsively to seize her hand,
as it hung beside his head, and kiss it passionately.&nbsp; He stood
up, still holding her fingers.</p>
<p>Picotee gasped out something, but was completely deprived of articulate
utterance, and in another moment being unable to control herself at
this sort of first meeting with the man she had gone through fire and
water to be near, and more particularly by the overpowering kiss upon
her hand, burst into hysterical sobbing.&nbsp; Julian, in his inability
to imagine so much emotion&mdash;or at least the exhibition of it&mdash;in
Ethelberta, gently drew Picotee further forward by the hand he held,
and utilized the solitary spot of light from the mirror by making it
fall upon her face.&nbsp; Recognizing the childish features, he at once,
with an exclamation, dropped her hand and started back.&nbsp; Being
in point of fact a complete bundle of nerves and nothing else, his thin
figure shook like a harp-string in painful excitement at a contretemps
which would scarcely have quickened the pulse of an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Poor Picotee, feeling herself in the wind of a civil d---, started
back also, sobbing more than ever.&nbsp; It was a little too much that
the first result of his discovery of the mistake should be absolute
repulse.&nbsp; She leant against the mantelpiece, when Julian, much
bewildered at her superfluity of emotion, assisted her to a seat in
sheer humanity.&nbsp; But Christopher was by no means pleased when he
again thought round the circle of circumstances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you allow such an absurd thing to happen?&rsquo;
he said, in a stern, though trembling voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;You knew I
might mistake.&nbsp; I had no idea you were in the house: I thought
you were miles away, at Sandbourne or somewhere!&nbsp; But I see: it
is just done for a joke, ha-ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This made Picotee rather worse still.&nbsp; &lsquo;O-O-O-O!&rsquo;
she replied, in the tone of pouring from a bottle.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
shall I do-o-o-o!&nbsp; It is&mdash;not done for a&mdash;joke at all-l-l-l!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not done for a joke?&nbsp; Then never mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t
cry, Picotee.&nbsp; What was it done for, I wonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee, mistaking the purport of his inquiry, imagined him to refer
to her arrival in the house, quite forgetting, in her guilty sense of
having come on his account, that he would have no right or thought of
asking questions about a natural visit to a sister, and she said: &lsquo;When
you&mdash;went away from&mdash;Sandbourne, I&mdash;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do, and then I ran away, and came here, and then Ethelberta&mdash;was
angry with me; but she says I may stay; but she doesn&rsquo;t know that
I know you, and how we used to meet along the road every morning&mdash;and
I am afraid to tell her&mdash;O, what shall I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind it,&rsquo; said Christopher, a sense of the true
state of her case dawning upon him with unpleasant distinctness, and
bringing some irritation at his awkward position; though it was impossible
to be long angry with a girl who had not reasoning foresight enough
to perceive that doubtful pleasure and certain pain must be the result
of any meeting whilst hearts were at cross purposes in this way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is your sister?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t come down, unless she MUST,&rsquo; said
Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have vexed her, and she has a headache besides
that, and I came instead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that I mightn&rsquo;t be wasted altogether.&nbsp; Well,
it&rsquo;s a strange business between the three of us.&nbsp; I have
heard of one-sided love, and reciprocal love, and all sorts, but this
is my first experience of a concatenated affection.&nbsp; You follow
me, I follow Ethelberta, and she follows&mdash;Heaven knows who!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ladywell!&rsquo; said the mortified Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God, if I didn&rsquo;t think so!&rsquo; said Christopher,
feeling to the soles of his feet like a man in a legitimate drama.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; said the frightened girl hastily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am not sure it is Mr. Ladywell.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s altogether
a mistake of mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes, you want to screen her,&rsquo; said Christopher,
with a withering smile at the spot of light.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very sisterly,
doubtless; but none of that will do for me.&nbsp; I am too old a bird
by far&mdash;by very far!&nbsp; Now are you sure she does not love Ladywell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps I blame her wrongly.&nbsp; She may have some
little good faith&mdash;a woman has, here and there.&nbsp; How do you
know she does not love Ladywell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because she would prefer Mr. Neigh to him, any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;you mistake, sir&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t love
either at all&mdash;Ethelberta doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I meant that she
cannot love Mr. Ladywell because he stands lower in her opinion than
Mr. Neigh, and him she certainly does not care for.&nbsp; She only loves
you.&nbsp; If you only knew how true she is you wouldn&rsquo;t be so
suspicious about her, and I wish I had not come here&mdash;yes, I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell what to think of it.&nbsp; Perhaps I don&rsquo;t
know much of this world after all, or what girls will do.&nbsp; But
you don&rsquo;t excuse her to me, Picotee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before this time Picotee had been simulating haste in getting a light;
but in her dread of appearing visibly to Christopher&rsquo;s eyes, and
showing him the precise condition of her tear-stained face, she put
it off moment after moment, and stirred the fire, in hope that the faint
illumination thus produced would be sufficient to save her from the
charge of stupid conduct as entertainer.</p>
<p>Fluttering about on the horns of this dilemma, she was greatly relieved
when Christopher, who read her difficulty, and the general painfulness
of the situation, said that since Ethelberta was really suffering from
a headache he would not wish to disturb her till to-morrow, and went
off downstairs and into the street without further ceremony.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other things had happened upstairs.&nbsp; No sooner had
Picotee left her sister&rsquo;s room, than Ethelberta thought it would
after all have been much better if she had gone down herself to speak
to this admirably persistent lover.&nbsp; Was she not drifting somewhat
into the character of coquette, even if her ground of offence&mdash;a
word of Christopher&rsquo;s about somebody else&rsquo;s mean parentage,
which was spoken in utter forgetfulness of her own position, but had
wounded her to the quick nevertheless&mdash;was to some extent a tenable
one?&nbsp; She knew what facilities in suffering Christopher always
showed; how a touch to other people was a blow to him, a blow to them
his deep wound, although he took such pains to look stolid and unconcerned
under those inflictions, and tried to smile as if he had no feelings
whatever.&nbsp; It would be more generous to go down to him, and be
kind.&nbsp; She jumped up with that alertness which comes so spontaneously
at those sweet bright times when desire and duty run hand in hand.</p>
<p>She hastily set her hair and dress in order&mdash;not such matchless
order as she could have wished them to be in, but time was precious&mdash;and
descended the stairs.&nbsp; When on the point of pushing open the drawing-room
door, which wanted about an inch of being closed, she was astounded
to discover that the room was in total darkness, and still more to hear
Picotee sobbing inside.&nbsp; To retreat again was the only action she
was capable of at that moment: the clash between this picture and the
anticipated scene of Picotee and Christopher sitting in frigid propriety
at opposite sides of a well-lighted room was too great.&nbsp; She flitted
upstairs again with the least possible rustle, and flung herself down
on the couch as before, panting with excitement at the new knowledge
that had come to her.</p>
<p>There was only one possible construction to be put upon this in Ethelberta&rsquo;s
rapid mind, and that approximated to the true one.&nbsp; She had known
for some time that Picotee once had a lover, or something akin to it,
and that he had disappointed her in a way which had never been told.&nbsp;
No stranger, save in the capacity of the one beloved, could wound a
woman sufficiently to make her weep, and it followed that Christopher
was the man of Picotee&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp; As Ethelberta recalled
the conversations, conclusion after conclusion came like pulsations
in an aching head.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, how did it happen, and who is to
blame?&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot doubt his faith,
and I cannot doubt hers; and yet how can I keep doubting them both?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Ethelberta&rsquo;s jealous motherly guard
over her young sisters that, amid these contending inquiries, her foremost
feeling was less one of hope for her own love than of championship for
Picotee&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2>23. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S HOUSE (continued)</h2>
<p>Picotee was heard on the stairs: Ethelberta covered her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he waiting?&rsquo; she said faintly, on finding that Picotee
did not begin to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he is gone,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, why is that?&rsquo; came quickly from under the handkerchief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He has forgotten me&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, he has not!&rsquo; said Picotee, just as bitterly.</p>
<p>Ethelberta had far too much heroism to let much in this strain escape
her, though her sister was prepared to go any lengths in the same.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; continued Ethelberta, in the quiet way of one
who had only a headache the matter with her, &lsquo;that he remembered
you after the meeting at Anglebury?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he remembered me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you tell me you had seen him before that time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had seen him at Sandbourne.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I
told you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At whose house did you meet him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At nobody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I only saw him sometimes,&rsquo;
replied Picotee, in great distress.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, though of all women most miserable, was brimming with
compassion for the throbbing girl so nearly related to her, in whom
she continually saw her own weak points without the counterpoise of
her strong ones.&nbsp; But it was necessary to repress herself awhile:
the intended ways of her life were blocked and broken up by this jar
of interests, and she wanted time to ponder new plans.&nbsp; &lsquo;Picotee,
I would rather be alone now, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You need not leave me any light; it makes my eyes ache, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee left the room.&nbsp; But Ethelberta had not long been alone
and in darkness when somebody gently opened the door, and entered without
a candle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta,&rsquo; said the soft voice of Picotee again, &lsquo;may
I come in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has everything
gone right with the house this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and Gwendoline went out just now to buy a few things,
and she is going to call round upon father when he has got his dinner
cleared away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope she will not stay and talk to the other servants.&nbsp;
Some day she will let drop something or other before father can stop
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Berta!&rsquo; said Picotee, close beside her.&nbsp; She
was kneeling in front of the couch, and now flinging her arm across
Ethelberta&rsquo;s shoulder and shaking violently, she pressed her forehead
against her sister&rsquo;s temple, and breathed out upon her cheek:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came in again to tell you something which I ought to have
told you just now, and I have come to say it at once because I am afraid
I shan&rsquo;t be able to to-morrow.&nbsp; Mr. Julian was the young
man I spoke to you of a long time ago, and I should have told you all
about him, but you said he was your young man too, and&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do then, because I thought it was wrong in me to love your
young man; and Berta, he didn&rsquo;t mean me to love him at all, but
I did it myself, though I did not want to do it, either; it would come
to me!&nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t know he belonged to you when I began
it, or I would not have let him meet me at all; no I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meet you? You don&rsquo;t mean to say he used to meet you?&rsquo;
whispered Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Picotee; &lsquo;but he could not help it.&nbsp;
We used to meet on the road, and there was no other road unless I had
gone ever so far round.&nbsp; But it is worse than that, Berta!&nbsp;
That was why I couldn&rsquo;t bide in Sandbourne, and&mdash;and ran
away to you up here; it was not because I wanted to see you, Berta,
but because I&mdash;I wanted&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rsquo; said Ethelberta hurriedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then when I went downstairs he mistook me for you for
a moment, and that caused&mdash;a confusion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, well, it does not much matter,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
kissing Picotee soothingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought not of course to
have come to London in such a manner; but, since you have come, we will
make the best of it.&nbsp; Perhaps it may end happily for you and for
him.&nbsp; Who knows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t you want him, Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; not at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you <i>really</i> want him, Berta?&rsquo;
repeated Picotee, starting up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would much rather he paid his addresses to you.&nbsp; He
is not the sort of man I should wish to&mdash;think it best to marry,
even if I were to marry, which I have no intention of doing at present.&nbsp;
He calls to see me because we are old friends, but his calls do not
mean anything more than that he takes an interest in me.&nbsp; It is
not at all likely that I shall see him again! and I certainly never
shall see him unless you are present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will be very nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And you will be always distant towards him, and
go to leave the room when he comes, when I will call you back; but suppose
we continue this to-morrow?&nbsp; I can tell you better then what to
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Picotee had left her the second time, Ethelberta turned over
upon her breast and shook in convulsive sobs which had little relationship
with tears.&nbsp; This abandonment ended as suddenly as it had begun&mdash;not
lasting more than a minute and a half altogether&mdash;and she got up
in an unconsidered and unusual impulse to seek relief from the stinging
sarcasm of this event&mdash;the unhappy love of Picotee&mdash;by mentioning
something of it to another member of the family, her eldest sister Gwendoline,
who was a woman full of sympathy.</p>
<p>Ethelberta descended to the kitchen, it being now about ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
The room was empty, Gwendoline not having yet returned, and Cornelia,
being busy about her own affairs upstairs.&nbsp; The French family had
gone to the theatre, and the house on that account was very quiet to-night.&nbsp;
Ethelberta sat down in the dismal place without turning up the gas,
and in a few minutes admitted Gwendoline.</p>
<p>The round-faced country cook floundered in, untying her bonnet as
she came, laying it down on a chair, and talking at the same time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Such a place as this London is, to be sure!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
turning on the gas till it whistled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I was down
in Wessex again.&nbsp; Lord-a-mercy, Berta, I didn&rsquo;t see it was
you!&nbsp; I thought it was Cornelia.&nbsp; As I was saying, I thought
that, after biding in this underground cellar all the week, making up
messes for them French folk, and never pleasing &rsquo;em, and never
shall, because I don&rsquo;t understand that line, I thought I would
go out and see father, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he very well?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and he is going to call round when he has time.&nbsp;
Well, as I was a-coming home-along I thought, &ldquo;Please the Lord
I&rsquo;ll have some chippols for supper just for a plain trate,&rdquo;
and I went round to the late greengrocer&rsquo;s for &rsquo;em; and
do you know they sweared me down that they hadn&rsquo;t got such things
as chippols in the shop, and had never heard of &rsquo;em in their lives.&nbsp;
At last I said, &ldquo;Why, how can you tell me such a brazen story?&mdash;here
they be, heaps of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;&nbsp; It made me so vexed that I
came away there and then, and wouldn&rsquo;t have one&mdash;no, not
at a gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They call them young onions here,&rsquo; said Ethelberta quietly;
&lsquo;you must always remember that.&nbsp; But, Gwendoline, I wanted&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta felt sick at heart, and stopped.&nbsp; She had come down
on the wings of an impulse to unfold her trouble about Picotee to her
hard-headed and much older sister, less for advice than to get some
heart-ease by interchange of words; but alas, she could proceed no further.&nbsp;
The wretched homeliness of Gwendoline&rsquo;s mind seemed at this particular
juncture to be absolutely intolerable, and Ethelberta was suddenly convinced
that to involve Gwendoline in any such discussion would simply be increasing
her own burden, and adding worse confusion to her sister&rsquo;s already
confused existence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were you going to say?&rsquo; said the honest and unsuspecting
Gwendoline.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will put it off until to-morrow,&rsquo; Ethelberta murmured
gloomily; &lsquo;I have a bad headache, and I am afraid I cannot stay
with you after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she ascended the stairs, Ethelberta ached with an added pain not
much less than the primary one which had brought her down.&nbsp; It
was that old sense of disloyalty to her class and kin by feeling as
she felt now which caused the pain, and there was no escaping it.&nbsp;
Gwendoline would have gone to the ends of the earth for her: she could
not confide a thought to Gwendoline!</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she only knew of that unworthy feeling of mine, how she
would grieve,&rsquo; said Ethelberta miserably.</p>
<p>She next went up to the servants&rsquo; bedrooms, and to where Cornelia
slept.&nbsp; On Ethelberta&rsquo;s entrance Cornelia looked up from
a perfect wonder of a bonnet, which she held in her hands.&nbsp; At
sight of Ethelberta the look of keen interest in her work changed to
one of gaiety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad&mdash;I was just coming down,&rsquo; Cornelia
said in a whisper; whenever they spoke as relations in this house it
was in whispers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, how do you think this bonnet will
do?&nbsp; May I come down, and see how I look in your big glass?&rsquo;&nbsp;
She clapped the bonnet upon her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it do
beautiful for Sunday afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It looks very attractive, as far as I can see by this light,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;But is it not rather too brilliant in
colour&mdash;blue and red together, like that?&nbsp; Remember, as I
often tell you, people in town never wear such bright contrasts as they
do in the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Berta!&rsquo; said Cornelia, in a deprecating tone; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
object.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s one thing I do glory in it is a nice
flare-up about my head o&rsquo; Sundays&mdash;of course if the family&rsquo;s
not in mourning, I mean.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, seeing that Ethelberta did
not smile, she turned the subject, and added docilely: &lsquo;Did you
come up for me to do anything?&nbsp; I will put off finishing my bonnet
if I am wanted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was going to talk to you about family matters, and Picotee,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, as you are busy, and I have a headache,
I will put it off till to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cornelia seemed decidedly relieved, for family matters were far from
attractive at the best of times; and Ethelberta went down to the next
floor, and entered her mother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>After a short conversation Mrs. Chickerel said, &lsquo;You say you
want to ask me something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: but nothing of importance, mother.&nbsp; I was thinking
about Picotee, and what would be the best thing to do&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well you may, Berta.&nbsp; I am so uneasy about this life
you have led us into, and full of fear that your plans may break down;
if they do, whatever will become of us?&nbsp; I know you are doing your
best; but I cannot help thinking that the coming to London and living
with you was wild and rash, and not well weighed afore we set about
it.&nbsp; You should have counted the cost first, and not advised it.&nbsp;
If you break down, and we are all discovered living so queer and unnatural,
right in the heart of the aristocracy, we should be the laughing-stock
of the country: it would kill me, and ruin us all&mdash;utterly ruin
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O mother, I know all that so well!&rsquo; exclaimed Ethelberta,
tears of anguish filling her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t depress
me more than I depress myself by such fears, or you will bring about
the very thing we strive to avoid!&nbsp; My only chance is in keeping
in good spirits, and why don&rsquo;t you try to help me a little by
taking a brighter view of things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I ought to, my dear girl, but I cannot.&nbsp; I do
so wish that I never let you tempt me and the children away from the
Lodge.&nbsp; I cannot think why I allowed myself to be so persuaded&mdash;cannot
think!&nbsp; You are not to blame&mdash;it is I.&nbsp; I am much older
than you, and ought to have known better than listen to such a scheme.&nbsp;
This undertaking seems too big&mdash;the bills frighten me.&nbsp; I
have never been used to such wild adventure, and I can&rsquo;t sleep
at night for fear that your tale-telling will go wrong, and we shall
all be exposed and shamed.&nbsp; A story-teller seems such an impossible
castle-in-the-air sort of a trade for getting a living by&mdash;I cannot
think how ever you came to dream of such an unheard-of thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is <i>not</i> a castle in the air, and it <i>does</i>
get a living!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, her lip quivering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, while it is just a new thing; but I am afraid it
cannot last&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I fear.&nbsp; People will find you
out as one of a family of servants, and their pride will be stung at
having gone to hear your romancing; then they will go no more, and what
will happen to us and the poor little ones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must all scatter again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we could get as we were once, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that.&nbsp;
But we shall have lost our character as simple country folk who know
nothing, which are the only class of poor people that squires will give
any help to; and I much doubt if the girls would get places after such
a discovery&mdash;it would be so awkward and unheard-of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, all I can say is,&rsquo; replied Ethelberta, &lsquo;that
I will do my best.&nbsp; All that I have is theirs and yours as much
as mine, and these arrangements are simply on their account.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like my relations being my servants; but if they did not
work for me, they would have to work for others, and my service is much
lighter and pleasanter than any other lady&rsquo;s would be for them,
so the advantages are worth the risk.&nbsp; If I stood alone, I would
go and hide my head in any hole, and care no more about the world and
its ways.&nbsp; I wish I was well out of it, and at the bottom of a
quiet grave&mdash;anybody might have the world for me then!&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t let me disturb you longer; it is getting late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta then wished her mother good-night, and went away.&nbsp;
To attempt confidences on such an ethereal matter as love was now absurd;
her hermit spirit was doomed to dwell apart as usual; and she applied
herself to deep thinking without aid and alone.&nbsp; Not only was there
Picotee&rsquo;s misery to disperse; it became imperative to consider
how best to overpass a more general catastrophe.</p>
<h2>24. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S HOUSE (continued)&mdash;THE BRITISH MUSEUM</h2>
<p>Mrs. Chickerel, in deploring the risks of their present speculative
mode of life, was far from imagining that signs of the foul future so
much dreaded were actually apparent to Ethelberta at the time the lament
was spoken.&nbsp; Hence the daughter&rsquo;s uncommon sensitiveness
to prophecy.&nbsp; It was as if a dead-reckoner poring over his chart
should predict breakers ahead to one who already beheld them.</p>
<p>That her story-telling would prove so attractive Ethelberta had not
ventured to expect for a moment; that having once proved attractive
there should be any falling-off until such time had elapsed as would
enable her to harvest some solid fruit was equally a surprise.&nbsp;
Future expectations are often based without hesitation upon one happy
accident, when the only similar condition remaining to subsequent sets
of circumstances is that the same person forms the centre of them.&nbsp;
Her situation was so peculiar, and so unlike that of most public people,
that there was hardly an argument explaining this triumphant opening
which could be used in forecasting the close; unless, indeed, more strategy
were employed in the conduct of the campaign than Ethelberta seemed
to show at present.</p>
<p>There was no denying that she commanded less attention than at first:
the audience had lessened, and, judging by appearances, might soon be
expected to be decidedly thin.&nbsp; In excessive lowness of spirit,
Ethelberta translated these signs with the bias that a lingering echo
of her mother&rsquo;s dismal words naturally induced, reading them as
conclusive evidence that her adventure had been chimerical in its birth.&nbsp;
Yet it was very far less conclusive than she supposed.&nbsp; Public
interest might without doubt have been renewed after a due interval,
some of the falling-off being only an accident of the season.&nbsp;
Her novelties had been hailed with pleasure, the rather that their freshness
tickled than that their intrinsic merit was appreciated; and, like many
inexperienced dispensers of a unique charm, Ethelberta, by bestowing
too liberally and too frequently, was destroying the very element upon
which its popularity depended.&nbsp; Her entertainment had been good
in its conception, and partly good in its execution; yet her success
had but little to do with that goodness.&nbsp; Indeed, what might be
called its badness in a histrionic sense&mdash;that is, her look sometimes
of being out of place, the sight of a beautiful woman on a platform,
revealing tender airs of domesticity which showed her to belong by character
to a quiet drawing-room&mdash;had been primarily an attractive feature.&nbsp;
But alas, custom was staling this by improving her up to the mark of
an utter impersonator, thereby eradicating the pretty abashments of
a poetess out of her sphere; and more than one well-wisher who observed
Ethelberta from afar feared that it might some day come to be said of
her that she had</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Enfeoffed herself to popularity:<br />
That, being daily swallowed by men&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
They surfeited with honey, and began<br />
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little<br />
More than a little is by much too much.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this in its extremity was not quite yet.</p>
<p>We discover her one day, a little after this time, sitting before
a table strewed with accounts and bills from different tradesmen of
the neighbourhood, which she examined with a pale face, collecting their
totals on a blank sheet.&nbsp; Picotee came into the room, but Ethelberta
took no notice whatever of her.&nbsp; The younger sister, who subsisted
on scraps of notice and favour, like a dependent animal, even if these
were only an occasional glance of the eye, could not help saying at
last, &lsquo;Berta, how silent you are.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you
know I am in the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not observe you,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am very much engaged: these bills have to be paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, and cannot we pay them?&rsquo; said Picotee, in vague
alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, I can pay them.&nbsp; The question is, how long shall
I be able to do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is sad; and we are going on so nicely, too.&nbsp; It
is not true that you have really decided to leave off story-telling
now the people don&rsquo;t crowd to hear it as they did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I shall leave off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And begin again next year?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is very doubtful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you might do,&rsquo; said Picotee,
her face kindling with a sense of great originality.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
might travel about to country towns and tell your story splendidly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man in my position might perhaps do it with impunity; but
I could not without losing ground in other domains.&nbsp; A woman may
drive to Mayfair from her house in Exonbury Crescent, and speak from
a platform there, and be supposed to do it as an original way of amusing
herself; but when it comes to starring in the provinces she establishes
herself as a woman of a different breed and habit.&nbsp; I wish I were
a man!&nbsp; I would give up this house, advertise it to be let furnished,
and sally forth with confidence.&nbsp; But I am driven to think of other
ways to manage than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee fell into a conjectural look, but could not guess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The way of marriage,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Otherwise
perhaps the poetess may live to become what Dryden called himself when
he got old and poor&mdash;a rent-charge on Providence. . . . .&nbsp;
Yes, I must try that way,&rsquo; she continued, with a sarcasm towards
people out of hearing.&nbsp; I must buy a &ldquo;Peerage&rdquo; for
one thing, and a &ldquo;Baronetage,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;House of Commons,&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;Landed Gentry,&rdquo; and learn what people are about me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must go to Doctors&rsquo; Commons and read up wills of the
parents of any likely gudgeons I may know.&nbsp; I must get a Herald
to invent an escutcheon of my family, and throw a genealogical tree
into the bargain in consideration of my taking a few second-hand heirlooms
of a pawnbroking friend of his.&nbsp; I must get up sham ancestors,
and find out some notorious name to start my pedigree from.&nbsp; It
does not matter what his character was; either villain or martyr will
do, provided that he lived five hundred years ago.&nbsp; It would be
considered far more creditable to make good my descent from Satan in
the age when he went to and fro on the earth than from a ministering
angel under Victoria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Berta, you are not going to marry any stranger who may
turn up?&rsquo; said Picotee, who had creeping sensations of dread when
Ethelberta talked like this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no such intention.&nbsp; But, having once put my hand
to the plough, how shall I turn back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might marry Mr. Ladywell,&rsquo; said Picotee, who preferred
to look at things in the concrete.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, marry him villainously; in cold blood, without a moment
to prepare himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not so sure about that.&nbsp; I have brought mother and
the children to town against her judgment and against my father&rsquo;s;
they gave way to my opinion as to one who from superior education has
larger knowledge of the world than they.&nbsp; I must prove my promises,
even if Heaven should fall upon me for it, or what a miserable future
will theirs be!&nbsp; We must not be poor in London.&nbsp; Poverty in
the country is a sadness, but poverty in town is a horror.&nbsp; There
is something not without grandeur in the thought of starvation on an
open mountain or in a wide wood, and your bones lying there to bleach
in the pure sun and rain; but a back garret in a rookery, and the other
starvers in the room insisting on keeping the window shut&mdash;anything
to deliver us from that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How gloomy you can be, Berta!&nbsp; It will never be so dreadful.&nbsp;
Why, I can take in plain sewing, and you can do translations, and mother
can knit stockings, and so on.&nbsp; How much longer will this house
be yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two years.&nbsp; If I keep it longer than that I shall have
to pay rent at the rate of three hundred a year.&nbsp; The Petherwin
estate provides me with it till then, which will be the end of Lady
Petherwin&rsquo;s term.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see it; and you ought to marry before the house is gone,
if you mean to marry high,&rsquo; murmured Picotee, in an inadequate
voice, as one confronted by a world so tragic that any hope of her assisting
therein was out of the question.</p>
<p>It was not long after this exposition of the family affairs that
Christopher called upon them; but Picotee was not present, having gone
to think of superhuman work on the spur of Ethelberta&rsquo;s awakening
talk.&nbsp; There was something new in the way in which Ethelberta received
the announcement of his name; passion had to do with it, so had circumspection;
the latter most, for the first time since their reunion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to leave this part of England,&rsquo; said Christopher,
after a few gentle preliminaries.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was one of the applicants
for the post of assistant-organist at Melchester Cathedral when it became
vacant, and I find I am likely to be chosen, through the interest of
one of my father&rsquo;s friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I congratulate you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Ethelberta, it is not worth that.&nbsp; I did not originally
mean to follow this course at all; but events seemed to point to it
in the absence of a better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I too am compelled to follow a course I did not originally
mean to take.&rsquo;&nbsp; After saying no more for a few moments, she
added, in a tone of sudden openness, a richer tincture creeping up her
cheek, &lsquo;I want to put a question to you boldly&mdash;not exactly
a question&mdash;a thought.&nbsp; Have you considered whether the relations
between us which have lately prevailed are&mdash;are the best for you&mdash;and
for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you mean,&rsquo; said Christopher, hastily anticipating
all that she might be going to say; &lsquo;and I am glad you have given
me the opportunity of speaking upon that subject.&nbsp; It has been
very good and considerate in you to allow me to share your society so
frequently as you have done since I have been in town, and to think
of you as an object to exist for and strive for.&nbsp; But I ought to
have remembered that, since you have nobody at your side to look after
your interests, it behoved me to be doubly careful.&nbsp; In short,
Ethelberta, I am not in a position to marry, nor can I discern when
I shall be, and I feel it would be an injustice to ask you to be bound
in any way to one lower and less talented than you.&nbsp; You cannot,
from what you say, think it desirable that the engagement should continue.&nbsp;
I have no right to ask you to be my betrothed, without having a near
prospect of making you my wife.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind saying this
straight out&mdash;I have no fear that you will doubt my love; thank
Heaven, you know what that is well enough!&nbsp; However, as things
are, I wish you to know that I cannot conscientiously put in a claim
upon your attention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A second meaning was written in Christopher&rsquo;s look, though
he scarcely uttered it.&nbsp; A woman so delicately poised upon the
social globe could not in honour be asked to wait for a lover who was
unable to set bounds to the waiting period.&nbsp; Yet he had privily
dreamed of an approach to that position&mdash;an unreserved, ideally
perfect declaration from Ethelberta that time and practical issues were
nothing to her; that she would stand as fast without material hopes
as with them; that love was to be an end with her henceforth, having
utterly ceased to be a means.&nbsp; Therefore this surreptitious hope
of his, founded on no reasonable expectation, was like a guilty thing
surprised when Ethelberta answered, with a predominance of judgment
over passion still greater than before:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is unspeakably generous in you to put it all before me
so nicely, Christopher.&nbsp; I think infinitely more of you for being
so unreserved, especially since I too have been thinking much on the
indefiniteness of the days to come.&nbsp; We are not numbered among
the blest few who can afford to trifle with the time.&nbsp; Yet to agree
to anything like a positive parting will be quite unnecessary.&nbsp;
You did not mean that, did you? for it is harsh if you did.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ethelberta smiled kindly as she said this, as much as to say that she
was far from really upbraiding him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let it be only that
we will see each other less.&nbsp; We will bear one another in mind
as deeply attached friends if not as definite lovers, and keep up friendly
remembrances of a sort which, come what may, will never have to be ended
by any painful process termed breaking off.&nbsp; Different persons,
different natures; and it may be that marriage would not be the most
favourable atmosphere for our old affection to prolong itself in.&nbsp;
When do you leave London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The disconnected query seemed to be subjoined to disperse the crude
effect of what had gone before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly know,&rsquo; murmured Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
suppose I shall not call here again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whilst they were silent somebody entered the room softly, and they
turned to discover Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here, Picotee,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>Picotee came with an abashed bearing to where the other two were
standing, and looked down steadfastly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Julian is going away,&rsquo; she continued, with determined
firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;He will not see us again for a long time.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Ethelberta added, in a lower tone, though still in the unflinching
manner of one who had set herself to say a thing, and would say it&mdash;&lsquo;He
is not to be definitely engaged to me any longer.&nbsp; We are not thinking
of marrying, you know, Picotee.&nbsp; It is best that we should not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it is,&rsquo; said Christopher hurriedly, taking up
his hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me now wish you good-bye; and, of course,
you will always know where I am, and how to find me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a tender time.&nbsp; He inclined forward that Ethelberta might
give him her hand, which she did; whereupon their eyes met.&nbsp; Mastered
by an impelling instinct she had not reckoned with, Ethelberta presented
her cheek.&nbsp; Christopher kissed it faintly.&nbsp; Tears were in
Ethelberta&rsquo;s eyes now, and she was heartfull of many emotions.&nbsp;
Placing her arm round Picotee&rsquo;s waist, who had never lifted her
eyes from the carpet, she drew the slight girl forward, and whispered
quickly to him&mdash;&lsquo;Kiss her, too.&nbsp; She is my sister, and
I am yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seemed all right and natural to their respective moods and the
tone of the moment that free old Wessex manners should prevail, and
Christopher stooped and dropped upon Picotee&rsquo;s cheek likewise
such a farewell kiss as he had imprinted upon Ethelberta&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Care for us both equally!&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Christopher, scarcely knowing what he
said.</p>
<p>When he had reached the door of the room, he looked back and saw
the two sisters standing as he had left them, and equally tearful.&nbsp;
Ethelberta at once said, in a last futile struggle against letting him
go altogether, and with thoughts of her sister&rsquo;s heart:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think that Picotee might correspond with Faith; don&rsquo;t
you, Mr. Julian?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sister would much like to do so,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you would like it too, would you not, Picotee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I can tell them
all about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it shall be so, if Miss Julian will.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
spoke in a settled way, as if something intended had been set in train;
and Christopher having promised for his sister, he went out of the house
with a parting smile of misgiving.</p>
<p>He could scarcely believe as he walked along that those late words,
yet hanging in his ears, had really been spoken, that still visible
scene enacted.&nbsp; He could not even recollect for a minute or two
how the final result had been produced.&nbsp; Did he himself first enter
upon the long-looming theme, or did she?&nbsp; Christopher had been
so nervously alive to the urgency of setting before the hard-striving
woman a clear outline of himself, his surroundings and his fears, that
he fancied the main impulse to this consummation had been his, notwithstanding
that a faint initiative had come from Ethelberta.&nbsp; All had completed
itself quickly, unceremoniously, and easily.&nbsp; Ethelberta had let
him go a second time; yet on foregoing mornings and evenings, when contemplating
the necessity of some such explanation, it had seemed that nothing less
than Atlantean force could overpower their mutual gravitation towards
each other.</p>
<p>On his reaching home Faith was not in the house, and, in the restless
state which demands something to talk at, the musician went off to find
her, well knowing her haunt at this time of the day.&nbsp; He entered
the spiked and gilded gateway of the Museum hard by, turned to the wing
devoted to sculptures, and descended to a particular basement room,
which was lined with bas-reliefs from Nineveh.&nbsp; The place was cool,
silent, and soothing; it was empty, save of a little figure in black,
that was standing with its face to the wall in an innermost nook.&nbsp;
This spot was Faith&rsquo;s own temple; here, among these deserted antiques,
Faith was always happy.&nbsp; Christopher looked on at her for some
time before she noticed him, and dimly perceived how vastly differed
her homely suit and unstudied contour&mdash;painfully unstudied to fastidious
eyes&mdash;from Ethelberta&rsquo;s well-arranged draperies, even from
Picotee&rsquo;s clever bits of ribbon, by which she made herself look
pretty out of nothing at all.&nbsp; Yet this negligence was his sister&rsquo;s
essence; without it she would have been a spoilt product.&nbsp; She
had no outer world, and her rusty black was as appropriate to Faith&rsquo;s
unseen courses as were Ethelberta&rsquo;s correct lights and shades
to her more prominent career.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, Kit,&rsquo; said Faith, as soon as she knew who was
approaching.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a thing I never learnt before; this
person is really Sennacherib, sitting on his throne; and these with
fluted beards and hair like plough-furrows, and fingers with no bones
in them, are his warriors&mdash;really carved at the time, you know.&nbsp;
Only just think that this is not imagined of Assyria, but done in Assyrian
times by Assyrian hands.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you feel as if you were actually
in Nineveh; that as we now walk between these slabs, so walked Ninevites
between them once?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp; Faith, it is all over.&nbsp; Ethelberta and
I have parted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&nbsp; And so my plan is to think of verses in the
Bible about Sennacherib and his doings, which resemble these; this verse,
for instance, I remember: &ldquo;Now in the fourteenth year of King
Hezekiah did Sennacherib, King of Assyria, come up against all the fenced
cities of Judah and took them.&nbsp; And Hezekiah, King of Judah, sent
to the King of Assyria to Lachish,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; Well, there
it actually is, you see.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Sennacherib, and there&rsquo;s
Lachish.&nbsp; Is it not glorious to think that this is a picture done
at the time of those very events?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; We did not quarrel this time, Ethelberta and I.&nbsp;
If I may so put it, it is worse than quarrelling.&nbsp; We felt it was
no use going on any longer, and so&mdash;Come, Faith, hear what I say,
or else tell me that you won&rsquo;t hear, and that I may as well save
my breath!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I will really listen,&rsquo; she said, fluttering her
eyelids in her concern at having been so abstracted, and excluding Sennacherib
there and then from Christopher&rsquo;s affairs by the first settlement
of her features to a present-day aspect, and her eyes upon his face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You said you had seen Ethelberta.&nbsp; Yes, and what did she
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there ever anybody so provoking!&nbsp; Why, I have just
told you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; I remember now.&nbsp; You have parted.&nbsp; The
subject is too large for me to know all at once what I think of it,
and you must give me time, Kit.&nbsp; Speaking of Ethelberta reminds
me of what I have done.&nbsp; I just looked into the Academy this morning&mdash;I
thought I would surprise you by telling you about it.&nbsp; And what
do you think I saw?&nbsp; Ethelberta&mdash;in the picture painted by
Mr. Ladywell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is never hung?&rsquo; said he, feeling that they were at
one as to a topic at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And the subject is an Elizabethan knight parting
from a lady of the same period&mdash;the words explaining the picture
being&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br />
And like enough thou know&rsquo;st thy estimate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lady is Ethelberta, to the shade of a hair&mdash;her living face;
and the knight is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Ladywell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so; I am not sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder I am dismissed!&nbsp; And yet she hates him.&nbsp;
Well, come along, Faith.&nbsp; Women allow strange liberties in these
days.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>25. THE ROYAL ACADEMY&mdash;THE FARNFIELD ESTATE</h2>
<p>Ethelberta was a firm believer in the kindly effects of artistic
education upon the masses.&nbsp; She held that defilement of mind often
arose from ignorance of eye; and her philanthropy being, by the simple
force of her situation, of that sort which lingers in the neighbourhood
of home, she concentrated her efforts in this kind upon Sol and Dan.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the Academy exhibition having now just opened, she ordered
the brothers to appear in their best clothes at the entrance to Burlington
House just after noontide on the Saturday of the first week, this being
the only day and hour at which they could attend without &lsquo;losing
a half&rsquo; and therefore it was necessary to put up with the inconvenience
of arriving at a crowded and enervating time.</p>
<p>When Ethelberta was set down in the quadrangle she perceived the
faithful pair, big as the Zamzummims of old time, standing like sentinels
in the particular corner that she had named to them: for Sol and Dan
would as soon have attempted petty larceny as broken faith with their
admired lady-sister Ethelberta.&nbsp; They welcomed her with a painfully
lavish exhibition of large new gloves, and chests covered with broad
triangular areas of padded blue silk, occupying the position that the
shirt-front had occupied in earlier days, and supposed to be lineally
descended from the tie of a neckerchief.</p>
<p>The dress of their sister for to-day was exactly that of a respectable
workman&rsquo;s relative who had no particular ambition in the matter
of fashion&mdash;a black stuff gown, a plain bonnet to match.&nbsp;
A veil she wore for obvious reasons: her face was getting well known
in London, and it had already appeared at the private view in an uncovered
state, when it was scrutinized more than the paintings around.&nbsp;
But now homely and useful labour was her purpose.</p>
<p>Catalogue in hand she took the two brothers through the galleries,
teaching them in whispers as they walked, and occasionally correcting
them&mdash;first, for too reverential a bearing towards the well-dressed
crowd, among whom they persisted in walking with their hats in their
hands and with the contrite bearing of meek people in church; and, secondly,
for a tendency which they too often showed towards straying from the
contemplation of the pictures as art to indulge in curious speculations
on the intrinsic nature of the delineated subject, the gilding of the
frames, the construction of the skylights overhead, or admiration for
the bracelets, lockets, and lofty eloquence of persons around them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, in a warning whisper, &lsquo;we
are coming near the picture which was partly painted from myself.&nbsp;
And, Dan, when you see it, don&rsquo;t you exclaim &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Berta to a T,&rdquo; or anything at all.&nbsp;
It would not matter were it not dangerous for me to be noticed here
to-day.&nbsp; I see several people who would recognize me on the least
provocation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a word,&rsquo; said Dan.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
be afeard about that.&nbsp; I feel that I baint upon my own ground to-day;
and wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to cause an upset, drown me if I would.&nbsp;
Would you, Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this temper they all pressed forward, and Ethelberta could not
but be gratified at the reception of Ladywell&rsquo;s picture, though
it was accorded by critics not very profound.&nbsp; It was an operation
of some minutes to get exactly opposite, and when side by side the three
stood there they overheard the immediate reason of the pressure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing&rsquo; had been
lengthily discoursed upon that morning by the Coryphaeus of popular
opinion; and the spirit having once been poured out sons and daughters
could prophesy.&nbsp; But, in truth, Ladywell&rsquo;s work, if not emphatically
original, was happily centred on a middle stratum of taste, and apart
from this adventitious help commanded, and deserved to command, a wide
area of appreciation.</p>
<p>While they were standing here in the very heart of the throng Ethelberta&rsquo;s
ears were arrested by two male voices behind her, whose words formed
a novel contrast to those of the other speakers around.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some men, you see, with extravagant expectations of themselves,
coolly get them gratified, while others hope rationally and are disappointed.&nbsp;
Luck, that&rsquo;s what it is.&nbsp; And the more easily a man takes
life the more persistently does luck follow him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course; because, if he&rsquo;s industrious he does not
want luck&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp; Natural laws will help him instead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if it is true that Ladywell has painted a good picture
he has done it by an exhaustive process.&nbsp; He has painted every
possible bad one till nothing more of that sort is left for him.&nbsp;
You know what lady&rsquo;s face served as the original to this, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s, I hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mrs. Alfred Neigh that&rsquo;s to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, that elusive fellow caught at last?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it appears; but she herself is hardly so well secured as
yet, it seems, though he takes the uncertainty as coolly as possible.&nbsp;
I knew nothing about it till he introduced the subject as we were standing
here on Monday, and said, in an off-hand way, &ldquo;I mean to marry
that lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him how.&nbsp; &ldquo;Easily,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;I will have her if there are a hundred at her heels.&rdquo;&nbsp;
You will understand that this was quite in confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, of course.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then there was a slight
laugh, and the companions proceeded to other gossip.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, calm and compressed in manner, sidled along to extricate
herself, not daring to turn round, and Dan and Sol followed, till they
were all clear of the spot.&nbsp; The brothers, who had heard the words
equally well with Ethelberta, made no remark to her upon them, assuming
that they referred to some peculiar system of courtship adopted in high
life, with which they had rightly no concern.</p>
<p>Ethelberta ostensibly continued her business of tutoring the young
workmen just as before, though every emotion in her had been put on
the alert by this discovery.&nbsp; She had known that Neigh admired
her; yet his presumption in uttering such a remark as he was reported
to have uttered, confidentially or otherwise, nearly took away her breath.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was not altogether disagreeable to have her breath so taken
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to marry that lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; She whispered the
words to herself twenty times in the course of the afternoon.&nbsp;
Sol and Dan were left considerably longer to their private perceptions
of the false and true in art than they had been earlier in the day.</p>
<p>When she reached home Ethelberta was still far removed in her reflections;
and it was noticed afterwards that about this time in her career her
openness of manner entirely deserted her.&nbsp; She mostly was silent
as to her thoughts, and she wore an air of unusual stillness.&nbsp;
It was the silence and stillness of a starry sky, where all is force
and motion.&nbsp; This deep undecipherable habit sometimes suggested,
though it did not reveal, Ethelberta&rsquo;s busy brain to her sisters,
and they said to one another, &lsquo;I cannot think what&rsquo;s coming
to Berta: she is not so nice as she used to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The evening under notice was passed desultorily enough after the
discovery of Neigh&rsquo;s self-assured statement.&nbsp; Among other
things that she did after dark, while still musingly examining the probabilities
of the report turning out true, was to wander to the large attic where
the children slept, a frequent habit of hers at night, to learn if they
were snug and comfortable.&nbsp; They were talking now from bed to bed,
the person under discussion being herself.&nbsp; Herself seemed everywhere
to-day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that she is a fairy,&rsquo; Myrtle was insisting, &lsquo;because
she must be, to have such pretty things in her house, and wear silk
dresses such as mother and we and Picotee haven&rsquo;t got, and have
money to give us whenever we want it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emmeline says perhaps she knows the fairy&rsquo;s godmother,
and is not a fairy herself, because Berta is too tall for a real fairy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must be one; for when there was a notch burnt in the hem
of my pretty blue frock she said it should be gone in the morning if
I would go to bed and not cry; and in the morning it was gone, and all
nice and straight as new.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta was recalling to mind how she had sat up and repaired
the damage alluded to by cutting off half an inch of the skirt all round
and hemming it anew, when the breathing of the children became regular,
and they fell asleep.&nbsp; Here were bright little minds ready for
a training, which without money and influence she could never give them.&nbsp;
The wisdom which knowledge brings, and the power which wisdom may bring,
she had always assumed would be theirs in her dreams for their social
elevation.&nbsp; By what means were these things to be ensured to them
if her skill in bread-winning should fail her?&nbsp; Would not a well-contrived
marriage be of service?&nbsp; She covered and tucked in one more closely,
lifted another upon the pillow and straightened the soft limbs to an
easy position; then sat down by the window and looked out at the flashing
stars.&nbsp; Thoughts of Neigh&rsquo;s audacious statement returned
again upon Ethelberta.&nbsp; He had said that he meant to marry her.&nbsp;
Of what standing was the man who had uttered such an intention respecting
one to whom a politic marriage had become almost a necessity of existence?</p>
<p>She had often heard Neigh speak indefinitely of some estate&mdash;&lsquo;my
little place&rsquo; he had called it&mdash;which he had purchased no
very long time ago.&nbsp; All she knew was that its name was Farnfield,
that it lay thirty or forty miles out of London in a south-westerly
direction, a railway station in the district bearing the same name,
so that there was probably a village or small town adjoining.&nbsp;
Whether the dignity of this landed property was that of domain, farmstead,
allotment, or garden-plot, Ethelberta had not the slightest conception.&nbsp;
She was almost certain that Neigh never lived there, but that might
signify nothing.&nbsp; The exact size and value of the estate would,
she mused, be curious, interesting, and almost necessary information
to her who must become mistress of it were she to allow him to carry
out his singularly cool and crude, if tender, intention.&nbsp; Moreover,
its importance would afford a very good random sample of his worldly
substance throughout, from which alone, after all, could the true spirit
and worth and seriousness of his words be apprehended.&nbsp; Impecuniosity
may revel in unqualified vows and brim over with confessions as blithely
as a bird of May, but such careless pleasures are not for the solvent,
whose very dreams are negotiable, and are expressed with due care accordingly.</p>
<p>That Neigh had used the words she had far more than <i>prim&acirc;-facie</i>
appearances for believing.&nbsp; Neigh&rsquo;s own conduct towards her,
though peculiar rather than devoted, found in these words alone a reasonable
key.&nbsp; But, supposing the estate to be such a verbal hallucination
as, for instance, hers had been at Arrowthorne, when her poor, unprogressive,
hopelessly impracticable Christopher came there to visit her, and was
so wonderfully undeceived about her social standing: what a <i>fiasco</i>,
and what a cuckoo-cry would his utterances about marriage seem then.&nbsp;
Christopher had often told her of his expectations from &lsquo;Arrowthorne
Lodge,&rsquo; and of the blunders that had resulted in consequence.&nbsp;
Had not Ethelberta&rsquo;s affection for Christopher partaken less of
lover&rsquo;s passion than of old-established tutelary tenderness she
might have been reminded by this reflection of the transcendent fidelity
he had shown under that trial&mdash;as severe a trial, considering the
abnormal, almost morbid, development of the passion for position in
present-day society, as can be prepared for men who move in the ordinary,
unheroic channels of life.</p>
<p>By the following evening the consideration of this possibility, that
Neigh&rsquo;s position might furnish scope for such a disillusive discovery
by herself as hers had afforded to Christopher, decoyed Ethelberta into
a curious little scheme.&nbsp; She was piqued into a practical undertaking
by the man who could say to his friend with such <i>sangfroid</i>, &lsquo;I
mean to marry that lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Merely telling Picotee to prepare for an evening excursion, of which
she was to talk to no one, Ethelberta made ready likewise, and they
left the house in a cab about half-an-hour before sunset, and drove
to the Waterloo Station.</p>
<p>With the decline and departure of the sun a fog gathered itself out
of the low meadow-land that bordered the railway as they went along
towards the west, stretching over it like a placid lake, till at the
end of the journey, the mist became generally pervasive, though not
dense.&nbsp; Avoiding observation as much as they conveniently could,
the two sisters walked from the long wooden shed which formed the station
here, into the rheumy air and along the road to the open country.&nbsp;
Picotee occasionally questioned Ethelberta on the object of the strange
journey: she did not question closely, being satisfied that in such
sure hands as Ethelberta&rsquo;s she was safe.</p>
<p>Deeming it unwise to make any inquiry just yet beyond the simple
one of the way to Farnfield, Ethelberta led her companion along a newly-fenced
road across a heath.&nbsp; In due time they came to an ornamental gate
with a curved sweep of wall on each side, signifying the entrance to
some enclosed property or other.&nbsp; Ethelberta, being quite free
from any digested plan for encouraging Neigh in his resolve to wive,
was startled to find a hope in her that this very respectable beginning
before their eyes was the entrance to the Farnfield property: that she
hoped it was nevertheless unquestionable.&nbsp; Just beyond lay a turnpike-house,
where was dimly visible a woman in the act of putting up a shutter to
the front window.</p>
<p>Compelled by this time to come to special questions, Ethelberta instructed
Picotee to ask of this person if the place they had just passed was
the entrance to Farnfield Park.&nbsp; The woman replied that it was.&nbsp;
Directly she had gone indoors Ethelberta turned back again towards the
park gate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have we come for, Berta?&rsquo; said Picotee, as she
turned also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you some day,&rsquo; replied her sister.</p>
<p>It was now much past eight o&rsquo;clock, and, from the nature of
the evening, dusk.&nbsp; The last stopping up-train was about ten, so
that half-an-hour could well be afforded for looking round.&nbsp; Ethelberta
went to the gate, which was found to be fastened by a chain and padlock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, the London season,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>There was a wicket at the side, and they entered.&nbsp; An avenue
of young fir trees three or four feet in height extended from the gate
into the mist, and down this they walked.&nbsp; The drive was not in
very good order, and the two women were frequently obliged to walk on
the grass to avoid the rough stones in the carriage-way.&nbsp; The double
line of young firs now abruptly terminated, and the road swept lower,
bending to the right, immediately in front being a large lake, calm
and silent as a second sky.&nbsp; They could hear from somewhere on
the margin the purl of a weir, and around were clumps of shrubs, araucarias
and deodars being the commonest.</p>
<p>Ethelberta could not resist being charmed with the repose of the
spot, and hastened on with curiosity to reach the other side of the
pool, where, by every law of manorial topography, the mansion would
be situate.&nbsp; The fog concealed all objects beyond a distance of
twenty yards or thereabouts, but it was nearly full moon, and though
the orb was hidden, a pale diffused light enabled them to see objects
in the foreground.&nbsp; Reaching the other side of the lake the drive
enlarged itself most legitimately to a large oval, as for a sweep before
a door, a pile of rockwork standing in the midst.</p>
<p>But where should have been the front door of a mansion was simply
a rough rail fence, about four feet high.&nbsp; They drew near and looked
over.</p>
<p>In the enclosure, and on the site of the imaginary house, was an
extraordinary group.&nbsp; It consisted of numerous horses in the last
stage of decrepitude, the animals being such mere skeletons that at
first Ethelberta hardly recognized them to be horses at all; they seemed
rather to be specimens of some attenuated heraldic animal, scarcely
thick enough through the body to throw a shadow: or enlarged castings
of the fire-dog of past times.&nbsp; These poor creatures were endeavouring
to make a meal from herbage so trodden and thin that scarcely a wholesome
blade remained; the little that there was consisted of the sourer sorts
common on such sandy soils, mingled with tufts of heather and sprouting
ferns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have we come here, dear Berta?&rsquo; said Picotee, shuddering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly know,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>Adjoining this enclosure was another and smaller one, formed of high
boarding, within which appeared to be some sheds and outhouses.&nbsp;
Ethelberta looked through the crevices, and saw that in the midst of
the yard stood trunks of trees as if they were growing, with branches
also extending, but these were sawn off at the points where they began
to be flexible, no twigs or boughs remaining.&nbsp; Each torso was not
unlike a huge hat-stand, and suspended to the pegs and prongs were lumps
of some substance which at first she did not recognize; they proved
to be a chronological sequel to the previous scene.&nbsp; Horses&rsquo;
skulls, ribs, quarters, legs, and other joints were hung thereon, the
whole forming a huge open-air larder emitting not too sweet a smell.</p>
<p>But what Stygian sound was this?&nbsp; There had arisen at the moment
upon the mute and sleepy air a varied howling from a hundred tongues.&nbsp;
It had burst from a spot close at hand&mdash;a low wooden building by
a stream which fed the lake&mdash;and reverberated for miles.&nbsp;
No further explanation was required.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are close to a kennel of hounds,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
as Picotee held tightly to her arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;They cannot get out,
so you need not fear.&nbsp; They have a horrid way of suddenly beginning
thus at different hours of the night, for no apparent reason: though
perhaps they hear us.&nbsp; These poor horses are waiting to be killed
for their food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The experience altogether, from its intense melancholy, was very
depressing, almost appalling to the two lone young women, and they quickly
retraced their footsteps.&nbsp; The pleasant lake, the purl of the weir,
the rudimentary lawns, shrubberies, and avenue, had changed their character
quite.&nbsp; Ethelberta fancied at that moment that she could not have
married Neigh, even had she loved him, so horrid did his belongings
appear to be.&nbsp; But for many other reasons she had been gradually
feeling within this hour that she would not go out of her way at a beck
from a man whose interest was so unimpassioned.</p>
<p>Thinking no more of him as a possible husband she ceased to be afraid
to make inquiries about the peculiarities of his possessions.&nbsp;
In the high-road they came on a local man, resting from wheeling a wheelbarrow,
and Ethelberta asked him, with the air of a countrywoman, who owned
the estate across the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man owning that is one of the name of Neigh,&rsquo; said
the native, wiping his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a family that have
made a very large fortune by the knacker business and tanning, though
they be only sleeping partners in it now, and live like lords.&nbsp;
Mr. Neigh was going to pull down the old huts here, and improve the
place and build a mansion&mdash;in short, he went so far as to have
the grounds planted, and the roads marked out, and the fish-pond made,
and the place christened Farnfield Park; but he did no more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall never have a wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so why should I want
a house to put her in?&rdquo;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a terrible hater of women,
I hear, particularly the lower class.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and since then he has let half the land to the Honourable
Mr. Mountclere, a brother of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Mountclere
wanted the spot for a kennel, and as the land is too poor and sandy
for cropping, Mr. Neigh let him have it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis his hounds
that you hear howling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They passed on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Berta, why did we come down here?&rsquo;
said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see the nakedness of the land.&nbsp; It was a whim only,
and as it will end in nothing, it is not worth while for me to make
further explanation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was with a curious sense of renunciation that Ethelberta went
homeward.&nbsp; Neigh was handsome, grim-natured, rather wicked, and
an indifferentist; and these attractions interested her as a woman.&nbsp;
But the news of this evening suggested to Ethelberta that herself and
Neigh were too nearly cattle of one colour for a confession on the matter
of lineage to be well received by him; and without confidence of every
sort on the nature of her situation, she was determined to contract
no union at all.&nbsp; The sympathy of unlikeness might lead the scion
of some family, hollow and fungous with antiquity, and as yet unmarked
by a mesalliance, to be won over by her story; but the antipathy of
resemblance would be ineradicable.</p>
<h2>26. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S DRAWING-ROOM</h2>
<p>While Ethelberta during the next few days was dismissing that evening
journey from her consideration, as an incident altogether foreign to
the organized course of her existence, the hidden fruit thereof was
rounding to maturity in a species unforeseen.</p>
<p>Inferences unassailable as processes, are, nevertheless, to be suspected,
from the almost certain deficiency of particulars on some side or other.&nbsp;
The truth in relation to Neigh&rsquo;s supposed frigidity was brought
before her at the end of the following week, when Dan and Sol had taken
Picotee, Cornelia, and the young children to Kew for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Early that morning, hours before it was necessary, there had been
such a chatter of preparation in the house as was seldom heard there.&nbsp;
Sunday hats and bonnets had been retrimmed with such cunning that it
would have taken a milliner&rsquo;s apprentice at least to discover
that any thread in them was not quite new.&nbsp; There was an anxious
peep through the blind at the sky at daybreak by Georgina and Myrtle,
and the perplexity of these rural children was great at the weather-signs
of the town, where atmospheric effects had nothing to do with clouds,
and fair days and foul came apparently quite by chance.&nbsp; Punctually
at the hour appointed two friendly human shadows descended across the
kitchen window, followed by Sol and Dan, much to the relief of the children&rsquo;s
apprehensions that they might forget the day.</p>
<p>The brothers were by this time acquiring something of the airs and
manners of London workmen; they were less spontaneous and more comparative;
less genial, but smarter; in obedience to the usual law by which the
emotion that takes the form of humour in country workmen becomes transmuted
to irony among the same order in town.&nbsp; But the fixed and dogged
fidelity to one another under apparent coolness, by which this family
was distinguished, remained unshaken in these members as in all the
rest, leading them to select the children as companions in their holiday
in preference to casual acquaintance.&nbsp; At last they were ready,
and departed, and Ethelberta, after chatting with her mother awhile,
proceeded to her personal duties.</p>
<p>The house was very silent that day, Gwendoline and Joey being the
only ones left below stairs.&nbsp; Ethelberta was wishing that she had
thrown off her state and gone to Kew to have an hour of childhood over
again in a romp with the others, when she was startled by the announcement
of a male visitor&mdash;none other than Mr. Neigh.</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s attitude on receipt of this information sufficiently
expressed a revived sense that the incidence of Mr. Neigh on her path
might have a meaning after all.&nbsp; Neigh had certainly said he was
going to marry her, and now here he was come to her house&mdash;just
as if he meant to do it forthwith.&nbsp; She had mentally discarded
him; yet she felt a shock which was scarcely painful, and a dread which
was almost exhilarating.&nbsp; Her flying visit to Farnfield she thought
little of at this moment.&nbsp; From the fact that the mind prefers
imaginings to recapitulation, conjecture to history, Ethelberta had
dwelt more upon Neigh&rsquo;s possible plans and anticipations than
upon the incidents of her evening journey; and the former assumed a
more distinct shape in her mind&rsquo;s eye than anything on the visible
side of the curtain.</p>
<p>Neigh was perhaps not quite so placidly nonchalant as in ordinary;
still, he was by far the most trying visitor that Ethelberta had lately
faced, and she could not get above the stage&mdash;not a very high one
for the mistress of a house&mdash;of feeling her personality to be inconveniently
in the way of his eyes.&nbsp; He had somewhat the bearing of a man who
was going to do without any fuss what gushing people would call a philanthropic
action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been intending to write a line to you,&rsquo; said
Neigh; &lsquo;but I felt that I could not be sure of writing my meaning
in a way which might please you.&nbsp; I am not bright at a letter&mdash;never
was.&nbsp; The question I mean is one that I hope you will be disposed
to answer favourably, even though I may show the awkwardness of a fellow-person
who has never put such a question before.&nbsp; Will you give me a word
of encouragement&mdash;just a hope that I may not be unacceptable as
a husband to you?&nbsp; Your talents are very great; and of course I
know that I have nothing at all in that way.&nbsp; Still people are
happy together sometimes in spite of such things.&nbsp; Will you say
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and settle it now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not expecting you had come upon such an errand as this,&rsquo;
said she, looking up a little, but mostly looking down.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot say what you wish, Mr. Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I have been too sudden and presumptuous.&nbsp; Yes,
I know I have been that.&nbsp; However, directly I saw you I felt that
nobody ever came so near my idea of what is desirable in a lady, and
it occurred to me that only one obstacle should stand in the way of
the natural results, which obstacle would be your refusal.&nbsp; In
common kindness consider.&nbsp; I daresay I am judged to be a man of
inattentive habits&mdash;I know that&rsquo;s what you think of me; but
under your influence I should be very different; so pray do not let
your dislike to little matters influence you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not indeed.&nbsp; But believe me there can be no discussion
of marriage between us,&rsquo; said Ethelberta decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case I may as well say no more.&nbsp;
To burden you with my regrets would be out of place, I suppose,&rsquo;
said Neigh, looking calmly out of the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Apart from personal feeling, there are considerations which
would prevent what you contemplated,&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
affairs are too lengthy, intricate, and unpleasant for me to explain
to anybody at present.&nbsp; And that would be a necessary first step.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I cannot think that preliminary to be necessary
at all.&nbsp; I would put my lawyer in communication with yours, and
we would leave the rest to them: I believe that is the proper way.&nbsp;
You could say anything in confidence to your family-man; and you could
inquire through him anything you might wish to know about my&mdash;about
me.&nbsp; All you would need to say to myself are just the two little
words&mdash;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; in the church here at the end of the
Crescent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to pain you, Mr. Neigh&mdash;so sorry,&rsquo; said
Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I cannot say them.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was
rather distressed that, despite her discouraging words, he still went
on with his purpose, as if he imagined what she so distinctly said to
be no bar, but rather a stimulant, usual under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does not matter about paining me,&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take that into consideration at all.&nbsp; But I
did not expect you to leave me so entirely without help&mdash;to refuse
me absolutely as far as words go&mdash;after what you did.&nbsp; If
it had not been for that I should never have ventured to call.&nbsp;
I might otherwise have supposed your interest to be fixed in another
quarter; but your acting in that manner encouraged me to think you could
listen to a word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you allude to?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
have I acted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh appeared reluctant to go any further; but the allusion soon
became sufficiently clear.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish my little place at Farnfield
had been worthier of you,&rsquo; he said brusquely.&nbsp; &lsquo;However,
that&rsquo;s a matter of time only.&nbsp; It is useless to build a house
there yet.&nbsp; I wish I had known that you would be looking over it
at that time of the evening.&nbsp; A single word, when we were talking
about it the other day, that you were going to be in the neighbourhood,
would have been sufficient.&nbsp; Nothing could have given me so much
delight as to have driven you round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He knew that she had been to Farnfield: that knowledge was what had
inspired him to call upon her to-day!&nbsp; Ethelberta breathed a sort
of exclamation, not right out, but stealthily, like a parson&rsquo;s
damn.&nbsp; Her face did not change, since a face must be said not to
change while it preserves the same pleasant lines in the mobile parts
as before; but anybody who has preserved his pleasant lines under the
half-minute&rsquo;s peer of the invidious camera, and found what a wizened,
starched kind of thing they stiffen to towards the end of the time,
will understand the tendency of Ethelberta&rsquo;s lovely features now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I walked round,&rsquo; said Ethelberta faintly.</p>
<p>Neigh was decidedly master of the position at last; but he spoke
as if he did not value that.&nbsp; His knowledge had furnished him with
grounds for calling upon her, and he hastened to undeceive her from
supposing that he could think ill of any motive of hers which gave him
those desirable grounds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I supposed you, by that, to give some little thought to me
occasionally,&rsquo; he resumed, in the same slow and orderly tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How could I help thinking so?&nbsp; It was your doing that which
encouraged me.&nbsp; Now, was it not natural&mdash;I put it to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta was almost exasperated at perceiving the awful extent
to which she had compromised herself with this man by her impulsive
visit.&nbsp; Lightly and philosophically as he seemed to take it&mdash;as
a thing, in short, which every woman would do by nature unless hindered
by difficulties&mdash;it was no trifle to her as long as he was ignorant
of her justification; and this she determined that he should know at
once, at all hazards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was through you in the first place that I did look into
your grounds!&rsquo; she said excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was your presumption
that caused me to go there.&nbsp; I should not have thought of such
a thing else.&nbsp; If you had not said what you did say I never should
have thought of you or Farnfield either&mdash;Farnfield might have been
in Kamtschatka for all I cared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope sincerely that I never said anything to disturb you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you did&mdash;not to me, but to somebody,&rsquo; said
Ethelberta, with her eyes over-full of retained tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I said to somebody that can be in the least objectionable
to you?&rsquo; inquired Neigh, with much concern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said&mdash;you said, you meant to marry me&mdash;just
as if I had no voice in the matter!&nbsp; And that annoyed me, and made
me go there out of curiosity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh changed colour a little.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I did say it: I
own that I said it,&rsquo; he replied at last.&nbsp; Probably he knew
enough of her nature not to feel long disconcerted by her disclosure,
however she might have become possessed of the information.&nbsp; The
explanation was certainly a great excuse to her curiosity; but if Ethelberta
had tried she could not have given him a better ground for making light
of her objections to his suit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I felt that I must marry
you, that we were predestined to marry ages ago, and I feel it still!&rsquo;
he continued, with listless ardour.&nbsp; &lsquo;You seem to regret
your interest in Farnfield; but to me it is a charm, and has been ever
since I heard of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you only knew all!&rsquo; she said helplessly, showing,
without perceiving it, an unnecessary humility in the remark, since
there was no more reason just then that she should go into details about
her life than that he should about his.&nbsp; But melancholy and mistaken
thoughts of herself as a counterfeit had brought her to this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wish to know more,&rsquo; said Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would you marry any woman off-hand, without being thoroughly
acquainted with her circumstances?&rsquo; she said, looking at him curiously,
and with a little admiration, for his unconscionably phlegmatic treatment
of her motives in going to Farnfield had a not unbecoming daring about
it in Ethelberta&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would marry a woman off-hand when that woman is you.&nbsp;
I would make you mine this moment did I dare; or, to speak with absolute
accuracy, within twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Do assent to it, dear Mrs.
Petherwin, and let me be sure of you for ever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drive
to Doctors&rsquo; Commons this minute, and meet you to-morrow morning
at nine in the church just below.&nbsp; It is a simple impulse, but
I would adhere to it in the coolest moment.&nbsp; Shall it be arranged
in that way, instead of our waiting through the ordinary routine of
preparation?&nbsp; I am not a youth now, but I can see the bliss of
such an act as that, and the contemptible nature of methodical proceedings
beside it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had taken her hand.&nbsp; Ethelberta gave it a subtle movement
backwards to imply that he was not to retain the prize, and said, &lsquo;One
whose inner life is almost unknown to you, and whom you have scarcely
seen except at other people&rsquo;s houses!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know each other far better than we may think at first,&rsquo;
said Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are not people to love in a hurry, and I
have not done so in this case.&nbsp; As for worldly circumstances, the
most important items in a marriage contract are the persons themselves,
and, as far as I am concerned, if I get a lady fair and wise I care
for nothing further.&nbsp; I know you are beautiful, for all London
owns it; I know you are talented, for I have read your poetry and heard
your romances; and I know you are politic and discreet&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For I have examined your property,&rsquo; said she, with a
weak smile.</p>
<p>Neigh bowed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what more can I wish to know?&nbsp;
Come, shall it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would be entirely in your hands in that matter.&nbsp; I
will not urge you to be precipitate&mdash;I could not expect you to
be ready yet.&nbsp; My suddenness perhaps offended you; but, having
thought deeply of this bright possibility, I was apt to forget the forbearance
that one ought to show at first in mentioning it.&nbsp; If I have done
wrong forgive me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will think of that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, with a cooler
manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;But seriously, all these words are nothing to the
purpose.&nbsp; I must remark that I prize your friendship, but it is
not for me to marry now.&nbsp; You have convinced me of your goodness
of heart and freedom from unworthy suspicions; let that be enough.&nbsp;
The best way in which I in my turn can convince you of my goodness of
heart is by asking you to see me in private no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you refuse to think of me as ---.&nbsp; Why do you
treat me like that, after all?&rsquo; said Neigh, surprised at this
want of harmony with his principle that one convert to matrimony could
always find a second ready-made.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot explain, I cannot explain,&rsquo; said she, impatiently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would and I would not&mdash;explain I mean, not marry.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t love anybody, and I have no heart left for beginning.&nbsp;
It is only honest in me to tell you that I am interested in watching
another man&rsquo;s career, though that is not to the point either,
for no close relationship with him is contemplated.&nbsp; But I do not
wish to speak of this any more.&nbsp; Do not press me to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I will not,&rsquo; said Neigh, seeing that she was
distressed and sorrowful.&nbsp; &lsquo;But do consider me and my wishes;
I have a right to ask it for it is only asking a continuance of what
you have already begun to do.&nbsp; To-morrow I believe I shall have
the happiness of seeing you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not say no, and long after the door had closed upon him she
remained fixed in thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can he be blamed for his
manner,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;after knowing what I did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta as she sat felt herself much less a Petherwin than a Chickerel,
much less a poetess richly freighted with fancy than an adventuress
with a nebulous prospect.&nbsp; Neigh was one of the few men whose presence
seemed to attenuate her dignity in some mysterious way to its very least
proportions; and that act of espial, which had so quickly and inexplicably
come to his knowledge, helped his influence still more.&nbsp; She knew
little of the nature of the town bachelor; there were opaque depths
in him which her thoughts had never definitely plumbed.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
her exaltation to the atmosphere of the Petherwin family, Ethelberta
was very far from having the thoroughbred London woman&rsquo;s knowledge
of sets, grades, coteries, cliques, forms, glosses, and niceties, particularly
on the masculine side.&nbsp; Setting the years from her infancy to her
first look into town against those linking that epoch with the present,
the former period covered not only the greater time, but contained the
mass of her most vivid impressions of life and its ways.&nbsp; But in
recognizing her ignorance of the ratio between words to women and deeds
to women in the ethical code of the bachelor of the club, she forgot
that human nature in the gross differs little with situation, and that
a gift which, if the germs were lacking, no amount of training in clubs
and coteries could supply, was mother-wit like her own.</p>
<h2>27. MRS. BELMAINE&rsquo;S&mdash;CRIPPLEGATE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Neigh&rsquo;s remark that he believed he should see Ethelberta again
the next day referred to a contemplated pilgrimage of an unusual sort
which had been arranged for that day by Mrs. Belmaine upon the ground
of an incidental suggestion of Ethelberta&rsquo;s.&nbsp; One afternoon
in the week previous they had been chatting over tea at the house of
the former lady, Neigh being present as a casual caller, when the conversation
was directed upon Milton by somebody opening a volume of the poet&rsquo;s
works that lay on a table near.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:<br />
England hath need of thee&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said Mrs. Belmaine with the degree of flippancy which is considered
correct for immortal verse, the Bible, God, etc., in these days.&nbsp;
And Ethelberta replied, lit up by a quick remembrance, &lsquo;It is
a good time to talk of Milton; for I have been much impressed by reading
the &ldquo;Life;&rdquo; and I have decided to go and see his tomb.&nbsp;
Could we not all go?&nbsp; We ought to quicken our memories of the great,
and of where they lie, by such a visit occasionally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We ought,&rsquo; said Mrs. Belmaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; continued Ethelberta, with
interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Westminster Abbey?&rsquo; said Mr. Belmaine, a common man
of thirty, younger than his wife, who had lately come into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; to where he lies comparatively alone&mdash;Cripplegate
Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always thought that Milton was buried in Poet&rsquo;s Corner,&rsquo;
said Mr. Belmaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So did I,&rsquo; said Neigh; &lsquo;but I have such an indifferent
head for places that my thinking goes for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it would be a pretty thing to do,&rsquo; said Mrs. Belmaine,
&lsquo;and instructive to all of us.&nbsp; If Mrs. Petherwin would like
to go, I should.&nbsp; We can take you in the carriage and call round
for Mrs. Doncastle on our way, and set you both down again coming back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would be excellent,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
is nowhere I like going to so much as the depths of the city.&nbsp;
The absurd narrowness of world-renowned streets is so surprising&mdash;so
crooked and shady as they are too, and full of the quaint smells of
old cupboards and cellars.&nbsp; Walking through one of them reminds
me of being at the bottom of some crevasse or gorge, the proper surface
of the globe being the tops of the houses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will come to take care of us, John?&nbsp; And you, Mr.
Neigh, would like to come?&nbsp; We will tell Mr. Ladywell that he may
join us if he cares to,&rsquo; said Mrs. Belmaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said her husband quietly; and Neigh said he
should like nothing better, after a faint aspect of apprehension at
the remoteness of the idea from the daily track of his thoughts.&nbsp;
Mr. Belmaine observing this, and mistaking it for an indication that
Neigh had been dragged into the party against his will by his over-hasty
wife, arranged that Neigh should go independently and meet them there
at the hour named if he chose to do so, to give him an opportunity of
staying away.&nbsp; Ethelberta also was by this time doubting if she
had not been too eager with her proposal.&nbsp; To go on such a sentimental
errand might be thought by her friends to be simply troublesome, their
adherence having been given only in the regular course of complaisance.&nbsp;
She was still comparatively an outsider here, her life with Lady Petherwin
having been passed chiefly in alternations between English watering-places
and continental towns.&nbsp; However, it was too late now to muse on
this, and it may be added that from first to last Ethelberta never discovered
from the Belmaines whether her proposal had been an infliction or a
charm, so perfectly were they practised in sustaining that complete
divorce between thinking and saying which is the hall-mark of high civilization.</p>
<p>But, however she might doubt the Belmaines, she had no doubt as to
Neigh&rsquo;s true sentiments: the time had come when he, notwithstanding
his air of being oppressed by almost every lively invention of town
and country for charming griefs to rest, would not be at all oppressed
by a quiet visit to the purlieus of St Giles&rsquo;s, Cripplegate, since
she was the originator, and was going herself.</p>
<p>It was a bright hope-inspiring afternoon in this mid-May time when
the carriage containing Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine, Mrs. Doncastle, and Ethelberta,
crept along the encumbered streets towards Barbican; till turning out
of that thoroughfare into Redcross Street they beheld the bold shape
of the old tower they sought, clothed in every neutral shade, standing
clear against the sky, dusky and grim in its upper stage, and hoary
grey below, where every corner of every stone was completely rounded
off by the waves of wind and storm.</p>
<p>All people were busy here: our visitors seemed to be the only idle
persons the city contained; and there was no dissonance&mdash;there
never is&mdash;between antiquity and such beehive industry; for pure
industry, in failing to observe its own existence and aspect, partakes
of the unobtrusive nature of material things.&nbsp; This intra-mural
stir was a flywheel transparent by excessive motion, through which Milton
and his day could be seen as if nothing intervened.&nbsp; Had there
been ostensibly harmonious accessories, a crowd of observing people
in search of the poetical, conscious of the place and the scene, what
a discord would have arisen there!&nbsp; But everybody passed by Milton&rsquo;s
grave except Ethelberta and her friends, and for the moment the city&rsquo;s
less invidious conduct appeared to her more respectful as a practice
than her own.</p>
<p>But she was brought out of this rumination by the halt at the church
door, and completely reminded of the present by finding the church open,
and Neigh&mdash;the, till yesterday, unimpassioned Neigh&mdash;waiting
in the vestibule to receive them, just as if he lived there.&nbsp; Ladywell
had not arrived.&nbsp; It was a long time before Ethelberta could get
back to Milton again, for Neigh was continuing to impend over her future
more and more visibly.&nbsp; The objects along the journey had distracted
her mind from him; but the moment now was as a direct renewal and prolongation
of the declaration-time yesterday, and as if in furtherance of the conclusion
of the episode.</p>
<p>They all alighted and went in, the coachman being told to take the
carriage to a quiet nook further on, and return in half-an-hour.&nbsp;
Mrs. Belmaine and her carriage some years before had accidentally got
jammed crosswise in Cheapside through the clumsiness of the man in turning
up a side street, blocking that great artery of the civilized world
for the space of a minute and a half, when they were pounced upon by
half-a-dozen policemen and forced to back ignominiously up a little
slit between the houses where they did not mean to go, amid the shouts
of the hindered drivers; and it was her nervous recollection of that
event which caused Mrs. Belmaine to be so precise in her directions
now.</p>
<p>By the time that they were grouped around the tomb the visit had
assumed a much more solemn complexion than any one among them had anticipated.&nbsp;
Ashamed of the influence that she discovered Neigh to be exercising
over her, and opposing it steadily, Ethelberta drew from her pocket
a small edition of Milton, and proposed that she should read a few lines
from &lsquo;Paradise Lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; The responsibility of producing
a successful afternoon was upon her shoulders; she was, moreover, the
only one present who could properly manage blank verse, and this was
sufficient to justify the proposal.</p>
<p>She stood with her head against the marble slab just below the bust,
and began a selected piece, Neigh standing a few yards off on her right
looking into his hat in order to listen accurately, Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine
and Mrs. Doncastle seating themselves in a pew directly facing the monument.&nbsp;
The ripe warm colours of afternoon came in upon them from the west,
upon the sallow piers and arches, and the infinitely deep brown pews
beneath, the aisle over Ethelberta&rsquo;s head being in misty shade
through which glowed a lurid light from a dark-stained window behind.&nbsp;
The sentences fell from her lips in a rhythmical cadence one by one,
and she could be fancied a priestess of him before whose image she stood,
when with a vivid suggestiveness she delivered here, not many yards
from the central money-mill of the world, yet out from the very tomb
of their author, the passage containing the words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Mammon led
them on;<br />
Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell<br />
From heaven.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she finished reading Ethelberta left the monument, and then
each one present strayed independently about the building, Ethelberta
turning to the left along the passage to the south door.&nbsp; Neigh&mdash;from
whose usually apathetic face and eyes there had proceeded a secret smouldering
light as he listened and regarded her&mdash;followed in the same direction
and vanished at her heels into the churchyard, whither she had now gone.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine exchanged glances, and instead of following the
pair they went with Mrs. Doncastle into the vestry to inquire of the
person in charge for the register of the marriage of Oliver Cromwell,
which was solemnized here.&nbsp; The church was now quite empty, and
its stillness was as a vacuum into which an occasional noise from the
street overflowed and became rarefied away to nothing.</p>
<p>Something like five minutes had passed when a hansom stopped outside
the door, and Ladywell entered the porch.&nbsp; He stood still, and,
looking inquiringly round for a minute or two, sat down in one of the
high pews, as if under the impression that the others had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>While he sat here Neigh reappeared at the south door opposite, and
came slowly in.&nbsp; Ladywell, in rising to go to him, saw that Neigh&rsquo;s
attention was engrossed by something he held in his hand.&nbsp; It was
his pocket-book, and Neigh was looking at a few loose flower-petals
which had been placed between the pages.&nbsp; When Ladywell came forward
Neigh looked up, started, and closed the book quickly, so that some
of the petals fluttered to the ground between the two men.&nbsp; They
were striped, red and white, and appeared to be leaves of the Harlequin
rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! here you are, Ladywell,&rsquo; he said, recovering himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We had given you up: my aunt said that you would not care to
come.&nbsp; They are all in the vestry.&rsquo;&nbsp; How it came to
pass that Neigh designated those in the vestry as &lsquo;all,&rsquo;
when there was one in the churchyard, was a thing that he himself could
hardly have explained, so much more had it to do with instinct than
with calculation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind them&mdash;don&rsquo;t interrupt them,&rsquo; said
Ladywell.&nbsp; &lsquo;The plain truth is that I have been very greatly
disturbed in mind; and I could not appear earlier by reason of it.&nbsp;
I had some doubt about coming at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neigh&mdash;I may as well tell you and have done with it.&nbsp;
I have found that a lady of my acquaintance has two strings to her bow,
or I am very much in error.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Mrs. Petherwin?&rsquo; said Neigh uneasily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I thought that&mdash;that fancy was over with you long ago.&nbsp;
Even your acquaintance with her was at an end, I thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a measure it is at an end.&nbsp; But let me tell you that
what you call a fancy has been anything but a fancy with me, to be over
like a spring shower.&nbsp; To speak plainly, Neigh, I consider myself
badly used by that woman; damn badly used.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Badly used?&rsquo; said Neigh mechanically, and wondering
all the time if Ladywell had been informed that Ethelberta was to be
one of the party to-day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I ought not to talk like that,&rsquo; said Ladywell,
adopting a lighter tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;All is fair in courtship, I suppose,
now as ever.&nbsp; Indeed, I mean to put a good face upon it: if I am
beaten, I am.&nbsp; But it is very provoking, after supposing matters
to be going on smoothly, to find out that you are quite mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you you were quite mistaken in supposing she cared
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just the point I was not mistaken in,&rsquo; said
Ladywell warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She did care for me, and I stood as well
with her as any man could stand until this fellow came, whoever he is.&nbsp;
I sometimes feel so disturbed about it that I have a good mind to call
upon her and ask his name.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you, Neigh?&nbsp; Will
you accompany me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would in a moment, but, but&mdash; I strongly advise you
not to go,&rsquo; said Neigh earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be rash,
you know, and rather unmannerly; and would only hurt your feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am always ready to yield to a friend&rsquo;s arguments.
. . .&nbsp; A sneaking scamp, that&rsquo;s what he is.&nbsp; Why does
he not show himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you really know who he is?&rsquo; said Neigh,
in a pronounced and exceptional tone, on purpose to give Ladywell a
chance of suspecting, for the position was getting awkward.&nbsp; But
Ladywell was blind as Bartimeus in that direction, so well had indifference
to Ethelberta&rsquo;s charms been feigned by Neigh until he thought
seriously of marrying her.&nbsp; Yet, unfortunately for the interests
of calmness, Ladywell was less blind with his outward eye.&nbsp; In
his reflections his glance had lingered again upon the pocket-book which
Neigh still held in his hand, and upon the two or three rose-leaves
on the floor, until he said idly, superimposing humorousness upon misery,
as men in love can:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rose-leaves, Neigh?&nbsp; I thought you did not care for flowers.&nbsp;
What makes you amuse yourself with such sentimental objects as those,
only fit for women, or painters like me?&nbsp; If I had not observed
you with my own eyes I should have said that you were about the last
man in the world to care for things of that sort.&nbsp; Whatever makes
you keep rose-leaves in your pocket-book?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best reason on earth,&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
woman gave them to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That proves nothing unless she is a great deal to you,&rsquo;
said Ladywell, with the experienced air of a man who, whatever his inferiority
in years to Neigh, was far beyond him in knowledge of that sort, by
virtue of his recent trials.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a great deal to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I did not know you to be such a confirmed misogynist I
should say that this is a serious matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is serious,&rsquo; said Neigh quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
probability is that I shall marry the woman who gave me these.&nbsp;
Anyhow I have asked her the question, and she has not altogether said
no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear it, Neigh,&rsquo; said Ladywell heartily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am glad to hear that your star is higher than mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Neigh could make further reply Ladywell was attracted by the
glow of green sunlight reflected through the south door by the grass
of the churchyard, now in all its spring freshness and luxuriance.&nbsp;
He bent his steps thither, followed anxiously by Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no idea there was such a lovely green spot in the city,&rsquo;
Ladywell continued, passing out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Trees too, planted in
the manner of an orchard.&nbsp; What a charming place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The place was truly charming just at that date.&nbsp; The untainted
leaves of the lime and plane trees and the newly-sprung grass had in
the sun a brilliancy of beauty that was brought into extraordinary prominence
by the sable soil showing here and there, and the charcoaled stems and
trunks out of which the leaves budded: they seemed an importation, not
a produce, and their delicacy such as would perish in a day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this round tower?&rsquo; Ladywell said again, walking
towards the iron-grey bastion, partly covered with ivy and Virginia
creeper, which stood obtruding into the enclosure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, didn&rsquo;t you know that was here?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
a piece of the old city wall,&rsquo; said Neigh, looking furtively around
at the same time.&nbsp; Behind the bastion the churchyard ran into a
long narrow strip, grassed like the other part, but completely hidden
from it by the cylinder of ragged masonry.&nbsp; On rounding this projection,
Ladywell beheld within a few feet of him a lady whom he knew too well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin here!&rsquo; exclaimed he, proving how ignorant
he had been of the composition of the party he was to meet, and accounting
at the same time for his laxity in attending it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot to tell you,&rsquo; said Neigh awkwardly, behind
him, &lsquo;that Mrs. Petherwin was to come with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s look was somewhat blushful and agitated, as if
from some late transaction: she appeared to have been secluding herself
there till she should have recovered her equanimity.&nbsp; However,
she came up to him and said, &lsquo;I did not see you before this moment:
we had been thinking you would not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While these words were being prettily spoken, Ladywell&rsquo;s face
became pale as death.&nbsp; On Ethelberta&rsquo;s bosom were the stem
and green calyx of a rose, almost all its flower having disappeared.&nbsp;
It had been a Harlequin rose, for two or three of its striped leaves
remained to tell the tale.</p>
<p>She could not help noticing his fixed gaze, and she said quickly,
&lsquo;Yes, I have lost my pretty rose: this may as well go now,&rsquo;
and she plucked the stem from its fastening in her dress and flung it
away.</p>
<p>Poor Ladywell turned round to meet Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine, whose voices
were beginning to be heard just within the church door, leaving Neigh
and Ethelberta together.&nbsp; It was a graceful act of young Ladywell&rsquo;s
that, in the midst of his own pain at the strange tale the rose-leaves
suggested&mdash;Neigh&rsquo;s rivalry, Ethelberta&rsquo;s mutability,
his own defeat&mdash;he was not regardless of the intense embarrassment
which might have been caused had he remained.</p>
<p>The two were silent at first, and it was evident that Ethelberta&rsquo;s
mood was one of anger at something that had gone before.&nbsp; She turned
aside from him to follow the others, when Neigh spoke in a tone somewhat
bitter and somewhat stern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;going like that!&nbsp; After being compromised
together, why don&rsquo;t you close with me?&nbsp; Ladywell knows all:
I had already told him that the rose-leaves were given me by my intended
wife.&nbsp; We seem to him to be practising deceptions all of a piece,
and what folly it is to play off so!&nbsp; As to what I did, that I
ask your forgiveness for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta looked upon the ground and maintained a compressed lip.&nbsp;
Neigh resumed: &lsquo;If I showed more feeling than you care for, I
insist that it was not more than was natural under the circumstances,
if not quite proper.&nbsp; Opinions may differ, but my experience goes
to prove that conventional squeamishness at such times as these is more
talked and written about than practised.&nbsp; Plain behaviour must
be expected when marriage is the question.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I do
say&mdash;and I cannot say more&mdash;that I am sincerely sorry to have
offended you by exceeding my privileges.&nbsp; I will never do so again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say privileges.&nbsp; You have none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry that I thought otherwise, and that others will
think so too.&nbsp; Ladywell is, at any rate, bent on thinking so. .
. .&nbsp; It might have been made known to him in a gentle way&mdash;but
God disposes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing to make known&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta, going from him.</p>
<p>By this time Ladywell had walked round the gravel walks with the
two other ladies and Mr. Belmaine, and they were all turning to come
back again.&nbsp; The young painter had deputed his voice to reply to
their remarks, but his understanding continued poring upon other things.&nbsp;
When he came up to Ethelberta, his agitation had left him: she too was
free from constraint; while Neigh was some distance off, carefully examining
nothing in particular in an old fragment of wall.</p>
<p>The little party was now united again as to its persons; though in
spirit far otherwise.&nbsp; They went through the church in general
talk, Ladywell sad but serene, and Ethelberta keeping far-removed both
from him and from Neigh.&nbsp; She had at this juncture entered upon
that Sphinx-like stage of existence in which, contrary to her earlier
manner, she signified to no one of her ways, plans, or sensations, and
spoke little on any subject at all.&nbsp; There were occasional smiles
now which came only from the face, and speeches from the lips merely.</p>
<p>The journey home was performed as they had come, Ladywell not accepting
the seat in Neigh&rsquo;s cab which was phlegmatically offered him.&nbsp;
Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s acquaintance with Ethelberta had been slight
until this day; but the afternoon&rsquo;s proceeding had much impressed
the matron with her younger friend.&nbsp; Before they parted she said,
with the sort of affability which is meant to signify the beginning
of permanent friendship: &lsquo;A friend of my husband&rsquo;s, Lord
Mountclere, has been anxious for some time to meet you.&nbsp; He is
a great admirer of the poems, and more still of the story-telling invention,
and your power in it.&nbsp; He has been present many times at the Mayfair
Hall to hear you.&nbsp; When will you dine with us to meet him?&nbsp;
I know you will like him.&nbsp; Will Thursday be convenient?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta stood for a moment reflecting, and reflecting hoped that
Mrs. Doncastle had not noticed her momentary perplexity.&nbsp; Crises
were becoming as common with her as blackberries; and she had foreseen
this one a long time.&nbsp; It was not that she was to meet Lord Mountclere,
for he was only a name and a distant profile to her: it was that her
father would necessarily be present at the meeting, in the most anomalous
position that human nature could endure.</p>
<p>However, having often proved in her disjointed experience that the
shortest way out of a difficulty lies straight through it, Ethelberta
decided to dine at the Doncastles&rsquo;, and, as she murmured that
she should have great pleasure in meeting any friend of theirs, set
about contriving how the encounter with her dearest relative might be
made safe and unsuspected.&nbsp; She bade them adieu blithely; but the
thoughts engendered by the invitation stood before her as sorrowful
and rayless ghosts which could not be laid.&nbsp; Often at such conjunctures
as these, when the futility of her great undertaking was more than usually
manifest, did Ethelberta long like a tired child for the conclusion
of the whole matter; when her work should be over, and the evening come;
when she might draw her boat upon the shore, and in some thymy nook
await eternal night with a placid mind.</p>
<h2>28. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S&mdash;MR. CHICKEREL&rsquo;S ROOM</h2>
<p>The question of Neigh or no Neigh had reached a pitch of insistence
which no longer permitted of dallying, even by a popular beauty.&nbsp;
His character was becoming defined to Ethelberta as something very differently
composed from that of her first imagining.&nbsp; She had set him down
to be a man whose external in excitability owed nothing to self-repression,
but stood as the natural surface of the mass within.&nbsp; Neigh&rsquo;s
urban torpor, she said, might have been in the first instance produced
by art, but, were it thus, it had gone so far as to permeate him.&nbsp;
This had been disproved, first surprisingly, by his reported statement;
wondrously, in the second place, by his call upon her and sudden proposal;
thirdly, to a degree simply astounding, by what had occurred in the
city that day.&nbsp; For Neigh, before the fervour had subsided which
was produced in him by her look and general power while reading &lsquo;Paradise
Lost,&rsquo; found himself alone with her in a nook outside the church,
and there had almost demanded her promise to be his wife.&nbsp; She
had replied by asking for time, and idly offering him the petals of
her rose, that had shed themselves in her hand.&nbsp; Neigh, in taking
them, pressed her fingers more warmly than she thought she had given
him warrant for, which offended her.&nbsp; It was certainly a very momentary
affair, and when it was over seemed to surprise himself almost as much
as it had vexed her; but it had reminded her of one truth which she
was in danger of forgetting.&nbsp; The town gentleman was not half so
far removed from Sol and Dan, and the hard-handed order in general,
in his passions as in his philosophy.&nbsp; He still continued to be
the male of his species, and when the heart was hot with a dream Pall
Mall had much the same aspect as Wessex.</p>
<p>Well, she had not accepted him yet; indeed, for the moment they were
in a pet with one another.&nbsp; Yet that might soon be cleared off,
and then recurred the perpetual question, would the advantage that might
accrue to her people by her marriage be worth the sacrifice?&nbsp; One
palliative feature must be remembered when we survey the matrimonial
ponderings of the poetess and romancer.&nbsp; What she contemplated
was not meanly to ensnare a husband just to provide incomes for her
and her family, but to find some man she might respect, who would maintain
her in such a stage of comfort as should, by setting her mind free from
temporal anxiety, enable her to further organize her talent, and provide
incomes for them herself.&nbsp; Plenty of saleable originality was left
in her as yet, but it was getting crushed under the rubbish of her necessities.</p>
<p>She was not sure that Neigh would stand the test of her revelations.&nbsp;
It would be possible to lead him to marry her without revealing anything&mdash;the
events of the last few days had shown her that&mdash;yet Ethelberta&rsquo;s
honesty shrank from the safe course of holding her tongue.&nbsp; It
might be pleasant to many a modern gentleman to find himself allied
with a lady, none of whose ancestors had ever pandered to a court, lost
an army, taken a bribe, oppressed a community, or broken a bank; but
the added disclosure that, in avoiding these stains, her kindred had
worked and continued to work with their hands for bread, might lead
such an one to consider that the novelty was dearly purchased.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was, upon the whole, dissatisfied with her progress thus
far.&nbsp; She had planned many things and fulfilled few.&nbsp; Had
her father been by this time provided for and made independent of the
world, as she had thought he might be, not only would her course with
regard to Neigh be quite clear, but the impending awkwardness of dining
with her father behind her chair could not have occurred.&nbsp; True,
that was a small matter beside her regret for his own sake that he was
still in harness; and a mere change of occupation would be but a tribute
to a fastidiousness which he did not himself share.&nbsp; She had frequently
tried to think of a vocation for him that would have a more dignified
sound, and be less dangerously close to her own path: the post of care-taker
at some provincial library, country stationer, registrar of births and
deaths, and many others had been discussed and dismissed in face of
the unmanageable fact that her father was serenely happy and comfortable
as a butler, looking with dread at any hint of change short of perfect
retirement.&nbsp; Since, then, she could not offer him this retirement,
what right had she to interfere with his mode of life at all?&nbsp;
In no other social groove on earth would he thrive as he throve in his
present one, to which he had been accustomed from boyhood, and where
the remuneration was actually greater than in professions ten times
as stately in name.</p>
<p>For the rest, too, Ethelberta had indulged in hopes, the high education
of the younger ones being the chief of these darling wishes.&nbsp; Picotee
wanted looking to badly enough.&nbsp; Sol and Dan required no material
help; they had quickly obtained good places of work under a Pimlico
builder; for though the brothers scarcely showed as yet the light-fingered
deftness of London artizans, the want was in a measure compensated by
their painstaking, and employers are far from despising country hands
who bring with them strength, industry, and a desire to please.&nbsp;
But their sister had other lines laid down for them than those of level
progress; to start them some day as masters instead of men was a long-cherished
wish of Ethelberta&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Thus she had quite enough machinery in her hands to keep decently
going, even were she to marry a man who would take a kindly view of
her peculiar situation, and afford her opportunities of strengthening
her powers for her kindred&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; But what would be the
result if, eighteen months hence&mdash;the date at which her occupation
of the house in Exonbury Crescent came to an end&mdash;she were still
a widow, with no accumulated capital, her platform talents grown homely
and stunted through narrow living, and her tender vein of poesy completely
dispersed by it?&nbsp; To calmly relinquish the struggle at that point
would have been the act of a stoic, but not of a woman, particularly
when she considered the children, the hopes of her mother for them,
and her own condition&mdash;though this was least&mdash;under the ironical
cheers which would greet a slip back into the mire.</p>
<p>It here becomes necessary to turn for a moment to Master Joey Chickerel,
Ethelberta&rsquo;s troublesome page and brother.&nbsp; The face of this
juvenile was that of a Graeco-Roman satyr to the furthest degree of
completeness.&nbsp; Viewed in front, the outer line of his upper lip
rose in a double arch nearly to his little round nostrils, giving an
expression of a jollity so delicious to himself as to compel a perpetual
drawing in of his breath.&nbsp; During half-laughs his lips parted in
the middle, and remained closed at the corners, which were small round
pits like his nostrils, the same form being repeated as dimples a little
further back upon his cheek.&nbsp; The opening for each eye formed a
sparkling crescent, both upper and under lid having the convexity upwards.</p>
<p>But during some few days preceding the dinner-party at the Doncastles&rsquo;
all this changed.&nbsp; The luxuriant curves departed, a compressed
lineality was to be observed everywhere, the pupils of his eyes seemed
flattened, and the carriage of his head was limp and sideways.&nbsp;
This was a feature so remarkable and new in him that Picotee noticed
it, and was lifted from the melancholy current of her own affairs in
contemplating his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;nothing,&rsquo; said Joey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing?&nbsp; How can you say so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The world&rsquo;s a holler mockery&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so it is, to some; but not to you,&rsquo; said Picotee,
sighing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk argument, Picotee.&nbsp; I only hope you&rsquo;ll
never feel what I feel now.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for my juties here
I know what I&rsquo;d do; I&rsquo;d &rsquo;list, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d
do.&nbsp; But having my position to fill here as the only responsible
man-servant in the house, I can&rsquo;t leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anybody been beating you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beating!&nbsp; Do I look like a person who gets beatings?&nbsp;
No, it is a madness,&rsquo; said Joey, putting his hand upon his chest.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The case is, I am in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Joey, a boy no bigger than you are!&rsquo; said Picotee
reprovingly.&nbsp; Her personal interest in the passion, however, provoked
her to inquire, in the next breath, &lsquo;Who is it?&nbsp; Do tell,
Joey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No bigger than I!&nbsp; What hev bigness to do with it?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s just like your old-fashioned notions.&nbsp; Bigness is
no more wanted in courting nowadays than in soldiering or smoking or
any other duty of man.&nbsp; Husbands is rare; and a promising courter
who means business will fetch his price in these times, big or small,
I assure ye.&nbsp; I might have been engaged a dozen times over as far
as the bigness goes.&nbsp; You should see what a miserable little fellow
my rival is afore you talk like that.&nbsp; Now you know I&rsquo;ve
got a rival, perhaps you&rsquo;ll own there must be something in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that seems like the real thing.&nbsp; But who is the
young woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Picotee.&nbsp; It is
Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s new maid.&nbsp; I called to see father last night,
and had supper there; and you should have seen how lovely she were&mdash;eating
sparrowgrass sideways, as if she were born to it.&nbsp; But, of course,
there&rsquo;s a rival&mdash;there always is&mdash;I might have known
that, and I will crush him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s new maid&mdash;if that was she
I caught a glimpse of the other day&mdash;is ever so much older than
you&mdash;a dozen years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to a man in love?&nbsp; Pooh&mdash;I wish
you would leave me, Picotee; I wants to be alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A short time after this Picotee was in the company of Ethelberta,
and she took occasion to mention Joey&rsquo;s attachment.&nbsp; Ethelberta
grew exceedingly angry directly she heard of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a fearful nuisance that boy is becoming,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Does father know anything of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;O no, he cannot;
he would not allow any such thing to go on; she is so much older than
Joey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think he wouldn&rsquo;t allow it!&nbsp; The fact
is I must be more strict about this growing friendliness between you
all and the Doncastle servants.&nbsp; There shall be absolutely no intimacy
or visiting of any sort.&nbsp; When father wants to see any of you he
must come here, unless there is a most serious reason for your calling
upon him.&nbsp; Some disclosure or reference to me otherwise than as
your mistress, will certainly be made else, and then I am ruined.&nbsp;
I will speak to father myself about Joey&rsquo;s absurd nonsense this
evening.&nbsp; I am going to see him on another matter.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Ethelberta sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am to dine there on Thursday,&rsquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To dine there, Berta?&nbsp; Well, that is a strange thing!&nbsp;
Why, father will be close to you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ethelberta quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I should like to see you sitting at a grand dinner-table,
among lordly dishes and shining people, and father about the room unnoticed!&nbsp;
Berta, I have never seen a dinner-party in my life, and father said
that I should some day; he promised me long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How will he be able to carry out that, my dear child?&rsquo;
said Ethelberta, drawing her sister gently to her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father says that for an hour and a half the guests are quite
fixed in the dining-room, and as unlikely to move as if they were trees
planted round the table.&nbsp; Do let me go and see you, Berta,&rsquo;
Picotee added coaxingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would give anything to see how
you look in the midst of elegant people talking and laughing, and you
my own sister all the time, and me looking on like puss-in-the-corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta could hardly resist the entreaty, in spite of her recent
resolution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will leave that to be considered when I come home to-night,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must hear what father says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After dark the same evening a woman, dressed in plain black and wearing
a hood, went to the servants&rsquo; entrance of Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s
house, and inquired for Mr. Chickerel.&nbsp; Ethelberta found him in
a room by himself, and on entering she closed the door behind her, and
unwrapped her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you sit with me a few minutes, father?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, for a quarter of an hour or so,&rsquo; said the butler.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Has anything happened?&nbsp; I thought it might be Picotee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s well yet.&nbsp; But I thought it best
to see you upon one or two matters which are harassing me a little just
now.&nbsp; The first is, that stupid boy Joey has got entangled in some
way with the lady&rsquo;s-maid at this house; a ridiculous affair it
must be by all account, but it is too serious for me to treat lightly.&nbsp;
She will worm everything out of him, and a pretty business it will be
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless my soul! why, the woman is old enough to be his
mother!&nbsp; I have never heard a sound of it till now.&nbsp; What
do you propose to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have hardly thought: I cannot tell at all.&nbsp; But we
will consider that after I have done.&nbsp; The next thing is, I am
to dine here Thursday&mdash;that is, to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You going to dine here, are you?&rsquo; said her father in
surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear me, that&rsquo;s news.&nbsp; We have a dinner-party
to-morrow, but I was not aware that you knew our people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have accepted the invitation,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But if you think I had better stay away, I will get out of it
by some means.&nbsp; Heavens! what does that mean&mdash;will anybody
come in?&rsquo; she added, rapidly pulling up her hood and jumping from
the seat as the loud tones of a bell clanged forth in startling proximity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;it is all safe,&rsquo; said her father.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is the area door&mdash;nothing to do with me.&nbsp; About the dinner:
I don&rsquo;t see why you may not come.&nbsp; Of course you will take
no notice of me, nor shall I of you.&nbsp; It is to be rather a large
party.&nbsp; Lord What&rsquo;s-his-name is coming, and several good
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he is coming to meet me, it appears.&nbsp; But, father,&rsquo;
she said more softly and slowly, &lsquo;how wrong it will be for me
to come so close to you, and never recognize you!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like it.&nbsp; I wish you could have given up service by this time;
it would have been so much less painful for us all round.&nbsp; I thought
we might have been able to manage it somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rsquo; said Mr. Chickerel crossly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is not the least reason why I should give up.&nbsp; I want
to save a little money first.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t like me as I
am, you must keep away from me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be uneasy about my
comfort; I am right enough, thank God.&nbsp; I can mind myself for many
a year yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta looked at him with tears in her eyes, but she did not
speak.&nbsp; She never could help crying when she met her father here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been in service now for more than seven-and-thirty
years,&rsquo; her father went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is an honourable calling;
and why should you maintain me because you can earn a few pounds by
your gifts, and an old woman left you her house and a few sticks of
furniture?&nbsp; If she had left you any money it would have been a
different thing, but as you have to work for every penny you get, I
cannot think of it.&nbsp; Suppose I should agree to come and live with
you, and then you should be ill, or such like, and I no longer able
to help myself?&nbsp; O no, I&rsquo;ll stick where I am, for here I
am safe as to food and shelter at any rate.&nbsp; Surely, Ethelberta,
it is only right that I, who ought to keep you all, should at least
keep your mother and myself?&nbsp; As to our position, that we cannot
help; and I don&rsquo;t mind that you are unable to own me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could own you&mdash;all of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you chose your course, my dear; and you must abide by
it.&nbsp; Having put your hand to the plough, it will be foolish to
turn back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would, I suppose.&nbsp; Yet I wish I could get a living
by some simple humble occupation, and drop the name of Petherwin, and
be Berta Chickerel again, and live in a green cottage as we used to
do when I was small.&nbsp; I am miserable to a pitiable degree sometimes,
and sink into regrets that I ever fell into such a groove as this.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t like covert deeds, such as coming here to-night, and many
are necessary with me from time to time.&nbsp; There is something without
which splendid energies are a drug; and that is a cold heart.&nbsp;
There is another thing necessary to energy, too&mdash;the power of distinguishing
your visions from your reasonable forecasts when looking into the future,
so as to allow your energy to lay hold of the forecasts only.&nbsp;
I begin to have a fear that mother is right when she implies that I
undertook to carry out visions and all.&nbsp; But ten of us are so many
to cope with.&nbsp; If God Almighty had only killed off three-quarters
of us when we were little, a body might have done something for the
rest; but as we are it is hopeless!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no use in your going into high doctrine like that,&rsquo;
said Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;As I said before, you chose your course.&nbsp;
You have begun to fly high, and you had better keep there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to do that there is only one way&mdash;that is, to do
it surely, so that I have some groundwork to enable me to keep up to
the mark in my profession.&nbsp; That way is marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marriage?&nbsp; Who are you going to marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God knows.&nbsp; Perhaps Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; Stranger things
have happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so they have; though not many wretcheder things.&nbsp;
I would sooner see you in your grave, Ethelberta, than Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
wife, or the wife of anybody like him, great as the honour would be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course that was only something to say; I don&rsquo;t know
the man even.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know his valet.&nbsp; However, marry who you may, I hope
you&rsquo;ll be happy, my dear girl.&nbsp; You would be still more divided
from us in that event; but when your mother and I are dead, it will
make little difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta placed her hand upon his shoulder, and smiled cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, father, don&rsquo;t despond.&nbsp; All will be well, and
we shall see no such misfortune as that for many a year.&nbsp; Leave
all to me.&nbsp; I am a rare hand at contrivances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are indeed, Berta.&nbsp; It seems to me quite wonderful
that we should be living so near together and nobody suspect the relationship,
because of the precautions you have taken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet the precautions were rather Lady Petherwin&rsquo;s than
mine, as you know.&nbsp; Consider how she kept me abroad.&nbsp; My marriage
being so secret made it easy to cut off all traces, unless anybody had
made it a special business to search for them.&nbsp; That people should
suspect as yet would be by far the more wonderful thing of the two.&nbsp;
But we must, for one thing, have no visiting between our girls and the
servants here, or they soon will suspect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta then laid down a few laws on the subject, and, explaining
the other details of her visit, told her father soon that she must leave
him.</p>
<p>He took her along the passage and into the area.&nbsp; They were
standing at the bottom of the steps, saying a few parting words about
Picotee&rsquo;s visit to see the dinner, when a female figure appeared
by the railing above, slipped in at the gate, and flew down the steps
past the father and daughter.&nbsp; At the moment of passing she whispered
breathlessly to him, &lsquo;Is that you, Mr. Chickerel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the butler.</p>
<p>She tossed into his arms a quantity of wearing apparel, and adding,
&lsquo;Please take them upstairs for me&mdash;I am late,&rsquo; rushed
into the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens, what does that mean?&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
holding her father&rsquo;s arm in her uneasiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the new lady&rsquo;s-maid, just come in from
an evening walk&mdash;that young scamp&rsquo;s sweetheart, if what you
tell me is true.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t yet know what her character is,
but she runs neck and neck with time closer than any woman I ever met.&nbsp;
She stays out at night like this till the last moment, and often throws
off her dashing courting-clothes in this way, as she runs down the steps,
to save a journey to the top of the house to her room before going to
Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s, who is in fact at this minute waiting for her.&nbsp;
Only look here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Chickerel gathered up a hat decked with
feathers and flowers, a parasol, and a light muslin train-skirt, out
of the pocket of the latter tumbling some long golden tresses of hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an extraordinary woman,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A perfect Cinderella.&nbsp; The idea of Joey getting desperate
about a woman like that; no doubt she has just come in from meeting
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt&mdash;a blockhead.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s his taste,
is it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon see if I can&rsquo;t cure his taste if
it inclines towards Mrs. Menlove.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Menlove; that&rsquo;s her name.&nbsp; She came about a fortnight
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is that Menlove&mdash;what shall we do!&rsquo; exclaimed
Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;The idea of the boy singling out her&mdash;why
it is ruin to him, to me, and to us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hastily explained to her father that Menlove had been Lady Petherwin&rsquo;s
maid and her own at some time before the death of her mother-in-law,
that she had only stayed with them through a three months&rsquo; tour
because of her flightiness, and hence had learnt nothing of Ethelberta&rsquo;s
history, and probably had never thought at all about it.&nbsp; But nevertheless
they were as well acquainted as a lady and her maid well could be in
the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like all such doubtful characters,&rsquo; continued
Ethelberta, &lsquo;she was one of the cleverest and lightest-handed
women we ever had about us.&nbsp; When she first came, my hair was getting
quite weak; but by brushing it every day in a peculiar manner, and treating
it as only she knew how, she brought it into splendid condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this is the devil to pay, upon my life!&rsquo; said
Mr. Chickerel, with a miserable gaze at the bundle of clothes and the
general situation at the same time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unfortunately for her
friendship, I have snubbed her two or three times already, for I don&rsquo;t
care about her manner.&nbsp; You know she has a way of trading on a
man&rsquo;s sense of honour till it puts him into an awkward position.&nbsp;
She is perfectly well aware that, whatever scrape I find her out in,
I shall not have the conscience to report her, because I am a man, and
she is a defenceless woman; and so she takes advantage of one&rsquo;s
feeling by making me, or either of the menservants, her bottle-holder,
as you see she has done now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is all simply dreadful,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Joey is shrewd and trustworthy; but in the hands of such a woman
as that!&nbsp; I suppose she did not recognize me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no chance of that in the dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I cannot do anything in it,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot manage Joey at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will see if I can,&rsquo; said Mr. Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Courting
at his age, indeed&mdash;what shall we hear next!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chickerel then accompanied his daughter along the street till an
empty cab passed them, and putting her into it he returned to the house
again.</p>
<h2>29. ETHELBERTA&rsquo;S DRESSING-ROOM&mdash;MR. DONCASTLE&rsquo;S
HOUSE</h2>
<p>The dressing of Ethelberta for the dinner-party was an undertaking
into which Picotee threw her whole skill as tirewoman.&nbsp; Her energies
were brisker that day than they had been at any time since the Julians
first made preparations for departure from town; for a letter had come
to her from Faith, telling of their arrival at the old cathedral city,
which was found to suit their inclinations and habits infinitely better
than London; and that she would like Picotee to visit them there some
day.&nbsp; Picotee felt, and so probably felt the writer of the letter,
that such a visit would not be very practicable just now; but it was
a pleasant idea, and for fastening dreams upon was better than nothing.</p>
<p>Such musings were encouraged also by Ethelberta&rsquo;s remarks as
the dressing went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will have a change soon,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;we will
go out of town for a few days.&nbsp; It will do good in many ways.&nbsp;
I am getting so alarmed about the health of the children; their faces
are becoming so white and thin and pinched that an old acquaintance
would hardly know them; and they were so plump when they came.&nbsp;
You are looking as pale as a ghost, and I daresay I am too.&nbsp; A
week or two at Knollsea will see us right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, how charming!&rsquo; said Picotee gladly.</p>
<p>Knollsea was a village on the coast, not very far from Melchester,
the new home of Christopher; not very far, that is to say, in the eye
of a sweetheart; but seeing that there was, as the crow flies, a stretch
of thirty-five miles between the two places, and that more than one-third
the distance was without a railway, an elderly gentleman might have
considered their situations somewhat remote from each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have you chosen Knollsea?&rsquo; inquired Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of aunt&rsquo;s letter from Rouen&mdash;have you seen
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not read it through.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wants us to get a copy of the register of her baptism;
and she is not absolutely certain which of the parishes in and about
Knollsea they were living in when she was born.&nbsp; Mother, being
a year younger, cannot tell of course.&nbsp; First I thought of writing
to the clergyman of each parish, but that would be troublesome, and
might reveal the secret of my birth; but if we go down there for a few
days, and take some lodgings, we shall be able to find out all about
it at leisure.&nbsp; Gwendoline and Joey can attend to mother and the
people downstairs, especially as father will look in every evening until
he goes out of town, to see if they are getting on properly.&nbsp; It
will be such a weight off my soul to slip away from acquaintances here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; At the same time I ought not to speak so, for they
have been very kind.&nbsp; I wish we could go to Rouen afterwards; aunt
repeats her invitation as usual.&nbsp; However, there is time enough
to think of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta was dressed at last, and, beholding the lonely look of
poor Picotee when about to leave the room, she could not help having
a sympathetic feeling that it was rather hard for her sister to be denied
so small an enjoyment as a menial peep at a feast when she herself was
to sit down to it as guest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you still want to go and see the procession downstairs
you may do so,&rsquo; she said reluctantly; &lsquo;provided that you
take care of your tongue when you come in contact with Menlove, and
adhere to father&rsquo;s instructions as to how long you may stay.&nbsp;
It may be in the highest degree unwise; but never mind, go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Ethelberta departed for the scene of action, just at the hour
of the sun&rsquo;s lowest decline, when it was fading away, yellow and
mild as candle-light, and when upper windows facing north-west reflected
to persons in the street dissolving views of tawny cloud with brazen
edges, the original picture of the same being hidden from sight by soiled
walls and slaty slopes.</p>
<p>Before entering the presence of host and hostess, Ethelberta contrived
to exchange a few words with her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In excellent time,&rsquo; he whispered, full of paternal pride
at the superb audacity of her situation here in relation to his.&nbsp;
&lsquo;About half of them are come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Neigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet; he&rsquo;s coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; He came absurdly early; ten minutes before anybody
else, so that Mrs. D. could hardly get on her bracelets and things soon
enough to scramble downstairs and receive him; and he&rsquo;s as nervous
as a boy.&nbsp; Keep up your spirits, dear, and don&rsquo;t mind me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, father.&nbsp; And let Picotee see me at dinner if
you can.&nbsp; She is very anxious to look at me.&nbsp; She will be
here directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Ethelberta, having been announced, joined the chamberful of assembled
guests, among whom for the present we lose sight of her.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Meanwhile the evening outside the house was deepening in tone, and
the lamps began to blink up.&nbsp; Her sister having departed, Picotee
hastily arrayed herself in a little black jacket and chip hat, and tripped
across the park to the same point.&nbsp; Chickerel had directed a maid-servant
known as Jane to receive his humbler daughter and make her comfortable;
and that friendly person, who spoke as if she had known Picotee five-and-twenty
years, took her to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, where the visitor deposited
her jacket and hat, and rested awhile.</p>
<p>A quick-eyed, light-haired, slight-built woman came in when Jane
had gone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you Miss Chickerel?&rsquo; she said to Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Picotee, guessing that this was Menlove,
and fearing her a little.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane tells me that you have come to visit your father, and
would like to look at the company going to dinner.&nbsp; Well, they
are not much to see, you know; but such as they are you are welcome
to the sight of.&nbsp; Come along with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I would rather wait for father, if you will excuse
me, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father is busy now; it is no use for you to think of
saying anything to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee followed her guide up a back staircase to the height of several
flights, and then, crossing a landing, they descended to the upper part
of the front stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now look over the balustrade, and you will see them all in
a minute,&rsquo; said Mrs. Menlove.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, you need not be
timid; you can look out as far as you like.&nbsp; We are all independent
here; no slavery for us: it is not as it is in the country, where servants
are considered to be of different blood and bone from their employers,
and to have no eyes for anything but their work.&nbsp; Here they are
coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee then had the pleasure of looking down upon a series of human
crowns&mdash;some black, some white, some strangely built upon, some
smooth and shining&mdash;descending the staircase in disordered column
and great discomfort, their owners trying to talk, but breaking off
in the midst of syllables to look to their footing.&nbsp; The young
girl&rsquo;s eyes had not drooped over the handrail more than a few
moments when she softly exclaimed, &lsquo;There she is, there she is!&nbsp;
How lovely she looks, does she not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; said Mrs. Menlove.</p>
<p>Picotee recollected herself, and hastily drew in her impulses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My dear mistress,&rsquo; she said blandly.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
is she on Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; And look, who is that funny
old man the elderly lady is helping downstairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is our honoured guest, Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; Mrs. Doncastle
will have him all through the dinner, and after that he will devote
himself to Mrs. Petherwin, your &ldquo;dear mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
keeps looking towards her now, and no doubt thinks it a nuisance that
she is not with him.&nbsp; Well, it is useless to stay here.&nbsp; Come
a little further&mdash;we&rsquo;ll follow them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Menlove
began to lead the way downstairs, but Picotee held back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t they see us?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; And if they do, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Mrs.
Doncastle would not object in the least to the daughter of her respected
head man being accidentally seen in the hall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They descended to the bottom and stood in the hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
there&rsquo;s father!&rsquo; whispered Picotee, with childlike gladness,
as Chickerel became visible to her by the door.&nbsp; The butler nodded
to his daughter, and became again engrossed in his duties.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could see her&mdash;my mistress&mdash;again,&rsquo;
said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem mightily concerned about your mistress,&rsquo; said
Menlove.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you want to see if you have dressed her properly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, partly; and I like her, too.&nbsp; She is very kind to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will have a chance of seeing her soon.&nbsp; When the
door is nicely open you can look in for a moment.&nbsp; I must leave
you now for a few minutes, but I will come again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Menlove departed, and Picotee stood waiting.&nbsp; She wondered how
Ethelberta was getting on, and whether she enjoyed herself as much as
it seemed her duty to do in such a superbly hospitable place.&nbsp;
Picotee then turned her attention to the hall, every article of furniture
therein appearing worthy of scrutiny to her unaccustomed eyes.&nbsp;
Here she walked and looked about for a long time till an excellent opportunity
offered itself of seeing how affairs progressed in the dining-room.</p>
<p>Through the partly-opened door there became visible a sideboard which
first attracted her attention by its richness.&nbsp; It was, indeed,
a noticeable example of modern art-workmanship, in being exceptionally
large, with curious ebony mouldings at different stages; and, while
the heavy cupboard doors at the bottom were enriched with inlays of
paler wood, other panels were decorated with tiles, as if the massive
composition had been erected on the spot as part of the solid building.&nbsp;
However, it was on a space higher up that Picotee&rsquo;s eyes and thoughts
were fixed.&nbsp; In the great mirror above the middle ledge she could
see reflected the upper part of the dining-room, and this suggested
to her that she might see Ethelberta and the other guests reflected
in the same way by standing on a chair, which, quick as thought, she
did.</p>
<p>To Picotee&rsquo;s dazed young vision her beautiful sister appeared
as the chief figure of a glorious pleasure-parliament of both sexes,
surrounded by whole regiments of candles grouped here and there about
the room.&nbsp; She and her companions were seated before a large flowerbed,
or small hanging garden, fixed at about the level of the elbow, the
attention of all being concentrated rather upon the uninteresting margin
of the bed, and upon each other, than on the beautiful natural objects
growing in the middle, as it seemed to Picotee.&nbsp; In the ripple
of conversation Ethelberta&rsquo;s clear voice could occasionally be
heard, and her young sister could see that her eyes were bright, and
her face beaming, as if divers social wants and looming penuriousness
had never been within her experience.&nbsp; Mr. Doncastle was quite
absorbed in what she was saying.&nbsp; So was the queer old man whom
Menlove had called Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dashing widow looks very well, does she not?&rsquo; said
a person at Picotee&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>It was her conductor Menlove, now returned again, whom Picotee had
quite forgotten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will do some damage here to-night you will find,&rsquo;
continued Menlove.&nbsp; &lsquo;How long have you been with her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, a long time&mdash;I mean rather a short time,&rsquo; stammered
Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know her well enough.&nbsp; I was her maid once, or rather
her mother-in-law&rsquo;s, but that was long before you knew her.&nbsp;
I did not by any means find her so lovable as you seem to think her
when I had to do with her at close quarters.&nbsp; An awful flirt&mdash;awful.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you find her so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t yet you will know.&nbsp; But come down
from your perch&mdash;the dining-room door will not be open again for
some time&mdash;and I will show you about the rooms upstairs.&nbsp;
This is a larger house than Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s, as you see.&nbsp;
Just come and look at the drawing-rooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wishing much to get rid of Menlove, yet fearing to offend her, Picotee
followed upstairs.&nbsp; Dinner was almost over by this time, and when
they entered the front drawing-room a young man-servant and maid were
there rekindling the lights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now let&rsquo;s have a game of cat-and-mice,&rsquo; said the
maid-servant cheerily.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time before
they come up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agreed,&rsquo; said Menlove promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will
play, will you not, Miss Chickerel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Picotee, aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, then; you look on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away then ran the housemaid and Menlove, and the young footman started
at their heels.&nbsp; Round the room, over the furniture, under the
furniture, through the furniture, out of one window, along the balcony,
in at another window, again round the room&mdash;so they glided with
the swiftness of swallows and the noiselessness of ghosts.</p>
<p>Then the housemaid drew a jew&rsquo;s-harp from her pocket, and struck
up a lively waltz sotto voce.&nbsp; The footman seized Menlove, who
appeared nothing loth, and began spinning gently round the room with
her, to the time of the fascinating measure</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Which fashion hails, from countesses to queens,<br />
And maids and valets dance behind the scenes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Picotee, who had been accustomed to unceiled country cottages all
her life, wherein the scamper of a mouse is heard distinctly from floor
to floor, exclaimed in a terrified whisper, at viewing all this, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll
hear you underneath, they&rsquo;ll hear you, and we shall all be ruined!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; came from the cautious dancers.&nbsp; &lsquo;These
are some of the best built houses in London&mdash;double floors, filled
in with material that will deaden any row you like to make, and we make
none.&nbsp; But come and have a turn yourself, Miss Chickerel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man relinquished Menlove, and on the spur of the moment
seized Picotee.&nbsp; Picotee flounced away from him in indignation,
backing into a corner with ruffled feathers, like a pullet trying to
appear a hen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dare you touch me!&rsquo; she said, with rounded eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell somebody downstairs of you, who&rsquo;ll soon
see about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a baby; she&rsquo;ll tell her father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No I shan&rsquo;t; somebody you are all afraid of, that&rsquo;s
who I&rsquo;ll tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Menlove; &lsquo;he meant no harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Playtime was now getting short, and further antics being dangerous
on that account, the performers retired again downstairs, Picotee of
necessity following.&nbsp; Her nerves were screwed up to the highest
pitch of uneasiness by the grotesque habits of these men and maids,
who were quite unlike the country servants she had known, and resembled
nothing so much as pixies, elves, or gnomes, peeping up upon human beings
from their shady haunts underground, sometimes for good, sometimes for
ill&mdash;sometimes doing heavy work, sometimes none; teasing and worrying
with impish laughter half suppressed, and vanishing directly mortal
eyes were bent on them.&nbsp; Separate and distinct from overt existence
under the sun, this life could hardly be without its distinctive pleasures,
all of them being more or less pervaded by thrills and titillations
from games of hazard, and the perpetual risk of sensational surprises.</p>
<p>Long before this time Picotee had begun to be anxious to get home
again, but Menlove seemed particularly to desire her company, and pressed
her to sit awhile, telling her young friend, by way of entertainment,
of various extraordinary love adventures in which she had figured as
heroine when travelling on the Continent.&nbsp; These stories had one
and all a remarkable likeness in a certain point&mdash;Menlove was always
unwilling to love the adorer, and the adorer was always unwilling to
live afterwards on account of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rsquo; in men&rsquo;s voices was heard from the
distant dining-room as the two women went on talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then,&rsquo; continued Menlove, &lsquo;there was that
duel I was the cause of between the courier and the French valet.&nbsp;
Dear me, what a trouble that was; yet I could do nothing to prevent
it.&nbsp; This courier was a very handsome man&mdash;they are handsome
sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they are.&nbsp; My aunt married one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she?&nbsp; Where do they live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They keep an hotel at Rouen,&rsquo; murmured Picotee, in doubt
whether this should have been told or not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he used to follow me to the English Church every Sunday
regularly, and I was so determined not to give my hand where my heart
could never be, that I slipped out at the other door while he stood
expecting me by the one I entered.&nbsp; Here I met M. Pierre, when,
as ill luck would have it, the other came round the corner, and seeing
me talking to the valet, he challenged him at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rsquo; was heard again afar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they fight?&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I believe they did.&nbsp; We left Nice the next day;
but I heard some time after of a duel not many miles off, and although
I could not get hold of the names, I make no doubt it was between those
two gentlemen.&nbsp; I never knew which of them fell; poor fellow, whichever
it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!&rsquo; came from the dining-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever are those boozy men laughing at, I wonder?&rsquo;
said Menlove.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are always so noisy when the ladies
have gone upstairs.&nbsp; Upon my soul, I&rsquo;ll run up and find out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; entreated Picotee, putting her
hand on her entertainer&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems wrong; it
is no concern of ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wrong be hanged&mdash;anything on an impulse,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Menlove, skipping across the room and out of the door, which stood
open, as did others in the house, the evening being sultry and oppressive.</p>
<p>Picotee waited in her seat until it occurred to her that she could
escape the lady&rsquo;s-maid by going off into her father&rsquo;s pantry
in her absence.&nbsp; But before this had been put into effect Menlove
appeared again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such fun as they are having up there,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Somebody asked Mr. Neigh to tell a story which he had told at
some previous time, but he was very reluctant to do so, and pretended
he could not recollect it.&nbsp; Well, then, the other man&mdash;I could
not distinguish him by his voice&mdash;began telling it, to prompt Mr.
Neigh&rsquo;s memory; and, as far as I could understand, it was about
some lady who thought Mr. Neigh was in love with her, and, to find whether
he was worth accepting or not, she went with her maid at night to see
his estate, and wandered about and got lost, and was frightened, and
I don&rsquo;t know what besides.&nbsp; Then Mr. Neigh laughed too, and
said he liked such common sense in a woman.&nbsp; No names were mentioned,
but I fancy, from the awkwardness of Mr. Neigh at being compelled to
tell it, that the lady is one of those in the drawing-room.&nbsp; I
should like to know which it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know&mdash;have heard something about it,&rsquo; said Picotee,
blushing with anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was nothing at all like that.&nbsp;
I wonder Mr. Neigh had the audacity ever to talk of the matter, and
to misrepresent it so greatly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell all about it, do,&rsquo; said Menlove.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;I promised not to
say a word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your mistress, I expect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may think what you like; but the lady is anything but
a mistress of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The flighty Menlove pressed her to tell the whole story, but finding
this useless the subject was changed.&nbsp; Presently her father came
in, and, taking no notice of Menlove, told his daughter that she had
been called for.&nbsp; Picotee very readily put on her things, and on
going outside found Joey awaiting her.&nbsp; Mr. Chickerel followed
closely, with sharp glances from the corner of his eye, and it was plain
from Joey&rsquo;s nervous manner of lingering in the shadows of the
area doorway instead of entering the house, that the butler had in some
way set himself to prevent all communion between the fair lady&rsquo;s-maid
and his son for that evening at least.</p>
<p>He watched Picotee and her brother off the premises, and the pair
went on their way towards Exonbury Crescent, very few words passing
between them.&nbsp; Picotee&rsquo;s thoughts had turned to the proposed
visit to Knollsea, and Joey was sulky under disappointment and the blank
of thwarted purposes.</p>
<h2>30. ON THE HOUSETOP</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Picotee, are you asleep?&rsquo; Ethelberta whispered softly
at dawn the next morning, by the half-opened door of her sister&rsquo;s
bedroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I keep waking, it is so warm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So do I.&nbsp; Suppose we get up and see the sun rise.&nbsp;
The east is filling with flame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I should like it,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>The restlessness which had brought Ethelberta hither in slippers
and dressing-gown at such an early hour owed its origin to another cause
than the warmth of the weather; but of that she did not speak as yet.&nbsp;
Picotee&rsquo;s room was an attic, with windows in the roof&mdash;a
chamber dismal enough at all times, and very shadowy now.&nbsp; While
Picotee was wrapping up, Ethelberta placed a chair under the window,
and mounting upon this they stepped outside, and seated themselves within
the parapet.</p>
<p>The air was as clear and fresh as on a mountain side; sparrows chattered,
and birds of a species unsuspected at later hours could be heard singing
in the park hard by, while here and there on ridges and flats a cat
might be seen going calmly home from the devilries of the night to resume
the amiabilities of the day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry I was asleep when you reached home,&rsquo; said
Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was so anxious to tell you something I heard
of, and to know what you did; but my eyes would shut, try as I might,
and then I tried no longer.&nbsp; Did you see me at all, Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never once.&nbsp; I had an impression that you were there.&nbsp;
I fancied you were from father&rsquo;s carefully vacuous look whenever
I glanced at his face.&nbsp; But were you careful about what you said,
and did you see Menlove?&nbsp; I felt all the time that I had done wrong
in letting you come; the gratification to you was not worth the risk
to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw her, and talked to her.&nbsp; But I am certain she suspected
nothing.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself very much, and there was no risk at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad it is no worse news.&nbsp; However, you must not
go there again: upon that point I am determined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a good thing I did go, all the same.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you why when you have told me what happened to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing of importance happened to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I expect you got to know the lord you were to meet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;Lord Mountclere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s dreadful how fond he is of you&mdash;quite
ridiculously taken up with you&mdash;I saw that well enough.&nbsp; Such
an old man, too; I wouldn&rsquo;t have him for the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t jump at conclusions so absurdly, Picotee.&nbsp;
Why wouldn&rsquo;t you have him for the world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he is old enough to be my grandfather, and yours too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed he is not; he is only middle-aged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Berta!&nbsp; Sixty-five at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may or may not be that; and if he is, it is not old.&nbsp;
He is so entertaining that one forgets all about age in connection with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He laughs like this&mdash;&ldquo;Hee-hee-hee!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Picotee introduced as much antiquity into her face as she could by screwing
it up and suiting the action to the word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This very odd thing occurred,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, to get
Picotee off the track of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s peculiarities, as it
seemed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was saying to Mr. Neigh that we were going to
Knollsea for a time, feeling that he would not be likely to know anything
about such an out-of-the-way place, when Lord Mountclere, who was near,
said, &ldquo;I shall be at Enckworth Court in a few days, probably at
the time you are at Knollsea.&nbsp; The Imperial Archaeological Association
holds its meetings in that part of Wessex this season, and Corvsgate
Castle, near Knollsea, is one of the places on our list.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he hoped I should be able to attend.&nbsp; Did you ever hear anything
so strange?&nbsp; Now, I should like to attend very much, not on Lord
Mountclere&rsquo;s account, but because such gatherings are interesting,
and I have never been to one; yet there is this to be considered, would
it be right for me to go without a friend to such a place?&nbsp; Another
point is, that we shall live in menagerie style at Knollsea for the
sake of the children, and we must do it economically in case we accept
Aunt Charlotte&rsquo;s invitation to Rouen; hence, if he or his friends
find us out there it will be awkward for me.&nbsp; So the alternative
is Knollsea or some other place for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be Knollsea, now we have once settled it,&rsquo; said
Picotee anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have mentioned to Faith Julian that
we shall be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mentioned it already!&nbsp; You must have written instantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a few minutes to spare, and I thought I might as well
write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; we will stick to Knollsea,&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
half in doubt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes&mdash;otherwise it will be difficult
to see about aunt&rsquo;s baptismal certificate.&nbsp; We will hope
nobody will take the trouble to pry into our household. . . .&nbsp;
And now, Picotee, I want to ask you something&mdash;something very serious.&nbsp;
How would you like me to marry Mr. Neigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta could not help laughing with a faint shyness as she asked
the question under the searching east ray.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has asked
me to marry him,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;and I want to know what
you would say to such an arrangement.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to imply
that the event is certain to take place; but, as a mere supposition,
what do you say to it, Picotee?&rsquo;&nbsp; Ethelberta was far from
putting this matter before Picotee for advice or opinion; but, like
all people who have an innate dislike to hole-and-corner policy, she
felt compelled to speak of it to some one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not like him for you at all,&rsquo; said Picotee
vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would rather you had Mr. Ladywell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t name him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have Mr. Neigh at any price, nevertheless.&nbsp;
It is about him that I was going to tell you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Picotee proceeded
to relate Menlove&rsquo;s account of the story of Ethelberta&rsquo;s
escapade, which had been dragged from Neigh the previous evening by
the friend to whom he had related it before he was so enamoured of Ethelberta
as to regard that performance as a positive virtue in her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody
was told, or even suspected, who the lady of the anecdote was,&rsquo;
Picotee concluded; &lsquo;but I knew instantly, of course, and I think
it very unfortunate that we ever went to that dreadful ghostly estate
of his, Berta.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s face heated with mortification.&nbsp; She had
no fear that Neigh had told names or other particulars which might lead
to her identification by any friend of his, and she could make allowance
for bursts of confidence; but there remained the awkward fact that he
himself knew her to be the heroine of the episode.&nbsp; What annoyed
her most was that Neigh could ever have looked upon her indiscretion
as a humorous incident, which he certainly must have done at some time
or other to account for his telling it.&nbsp; Had he been angry with
her, or sneered at her for going, she could have forgiven him; but to
see her manoeuvre in the light of a joke, to use it as illustrating
his grim theory of womankind, and neither to like nor to dislike her
the more for it from first to last, this was to treat her with a cynicism
which was intolerable.&nbsp; That Neigh&rsquo;s use of the incident
as a stock anecdote ceased long before he had decided to ask her to
marry him she had no doubt, but it showed that his love for her was
of that sort in which passion makes war upon judgment, and prevails
in spite of will.&nbsp; Moreover, he might have been speaking ironically
when he alluded to the act as a virtue in a woman, which seemed the
more likely when she remembered his cool bearing towards her in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; Possibly it was an antipathetic reaction, induced
by the renewed recollection of her proceeding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will never marry Mr. Neigh!&rsquo; she said, with decision.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That shall settle it.&nbsp; You need not think over any such
contingency, Picotee.&nbsp; He is one of those horrid men who love with
their eyes, the remainder part of him objecting all the time to the
feeling; and even if his objections prove the weaker, and the man marries,
his general nature conquers again by the time the wedding trip is over,
so that the woman is miserable at last, and had better not have had
him at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That applies still more to Lord Mountclere, to my thinking.&nbsp;
I never saw anything like the look of his eyes upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no&mdash;you understand nothing if you say that.&nbsp;
But one thing be sure of, there is no marriage likely to take place
between myself and Mr. Neigh.&nbsp; I have longed for a sound reason
for disliking him, and now I have got it.&nbsp; Well, we will talk no
more of this&mdash;let us think of the nice little pleasure we have
in store&mdash;our stay at Knollsea.&nbsp; There we will be as free
as the wind.&nbsp; And when we are down there, I can drive across to
Corvsgate Castle if I wish to attend the Imperial Association meeting,
and nobody will know where I came from.&nbsp; Knollsea is not more than
five miles from the Castle, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee was by this time beginning to yawn, and Ethelberta did not
feel nearly so wakeful as she had felt half-an-hour earlier.&nbsp; Tall
and swarthy columns of smoke were now soaring up from the kitchen chimneys
around, spreading horizontally when at a great height, and forming a
roof of haze which was turning the sun to a copper colour, and by degrees
spoiling the sweetness of the new atmosphere that had rolled in from
the country during the night, giving it the usual city smell.&nbsp;
The resolve to make this rising the beginning of a long and busy day,
which should set them beforehand with the rest of the world, weakened
with their growing weariness, and an impulse to lie down just for a
quarter of an hour before dressing, ended in a sound sleep that did
not relinquish its hold upon them till late in the forenoon.</p>
<h2>31. KNOLLSEA&mdash;A LOFTY DOWN&mdash;A RUINED CASTLE</h2>
<p>Knollsea was a seaside village lying snug within two headlands as
between a finger and thumb.&nbsp; Everybody in the parish who was not
a boatman was a quarrier, unless he were the gentleman who owned half
the property and had been a quarryman, or the other gentleman who owned
the other half, and had been to sea.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the inhabitants was of the same special sort as
their pursuits.&nbsp; The quarrymen in white fustian understood practical
geology, the laws and accidents of dips, faults, and cleavage, far better
than the ways of the world and mammon; the seafaring men in Guernsey
frocks had a clearer notion of Alexandria, Constantinople, the Cape,
and the Indies than of any inland town in their own country.&nbsp; This,
for them, consisted of a busy portion, the Channel, where they lived
and laboured, and a dull portion, the vague unexplored miles of interior
at the back of the ports, which they seldom thought of.</p>
<p>Some wives of the village, it is true, had learned to let lodgings,
and others to keep shops.&nbsp; The doors of these latter places were
formed of an upper hatch, usually kept open, and a lower hatch, with
a bell attached, usually kept shut.&nbsp; Whenever a stranger went in,
he would hear a whispering of astonishment from a back room, after which
a woman came forward, looking suspiciously at him as an intruder, and
advancing slowly enough to allow her mouth to get clear of the meal
she was partaking of.&nbsp; Meanwhile the people in the back room would
stop their knives and forks in absorbed curiosity as to the reason of
the stranger&rsquo;s entry, who by this time feels ashamed of his unwarrantable
intrusion into this hermit&rsquo;s cell, and thinks he must take his
hat off.&nbsp; The woman is quite alarmed at seeing that he is not one
of the fifteen native women and children who patronize her, and nervously
puts her hand to the side of her face, which she carries slanting.&nbsp;
The visitor finds himself saying what he wants in an apologetic tone,
when the woman tells him that they did keep that article once, but do
not now; that nobody does, and probably never will again; and as he
turns away she looks relieved that the dilemma of having to provide
for a stranger has passed off with no worse mishap than disappointing
him.</p>
<p>A cottage which stood on a high slope above this townlet and its
bay resounded one morning with the notes of a merry company.&nbsp; Ethelberta
had managed to find room for herself and her young relations in the
house of one of the boatmen, whose wife attended upon them all.&nbsp;
Captain Flower, the husband, assisted her in the dinner preparations,
when he slipped about the house as lightly as a girl and spoke of himself
as cook&rsquo;s mate.&nbsp; The house was so small that the sailor&rsquo;s
rich voice, developed by shouting in high winds during a twenty years&rsquo;
experience in the coasting trade, could be heard coming from the kitchen
between the chirpings of the children in the parlour.&nbsp; The furniture
of this apartment consisted mostly of the painting of a full-rigged
ship, done by a man whom the captain had specially selected for the
purpose because he had been seven-and-twenty years at sea before touching
a brush, and thereby offered a sufficient guarantee that he understood
how to paint a vessel properly.</p>
<p>Before this picture sat Ethelberta in a light linen dress, and with
tightly-knotted hair&mdash;now again Berta Chickerel as of old&mdash;serving
out breakfast to the rest of the party, and sometimes lifting her eyes
to the outlook from the window, which presented a happy combination
of grange scenery with marine.&nbsp; Upon the irregular slope between
the house and the quay was an orchard of aged trees wherein every apple
ripening on the boughs presented its rubicund side towards the cottage,
because that building chanced to lie upwards in the same direction as
the sun.&nbsp; Under the trees were a few Cape sheep, and over them
the stone chimneys of the village below: outside these lay the tanned
sails of a ketch or smack, and the violet waters of the bay, seamed
and creased by breezes insufficient to raise waves; beyond all a curved
wall of cliff, terminating in a promontory, which was flanked by tall
and shining obelisks of chalk rising sheer from the trembling blue race
beneath.</p>
<p>By one sitting in the room that commanded this prospect, a white
butterfly among the apple-trees might be mistaken for the sails of a
yacht far away on the sea; and in the evening when the light was dim,
what seemed like a fly crawling upon the window-pane would turn out
to be a boat in the bay.</p>
<p>When breakfast was over, Ethelberta sat leaning on the window-sill
considering her movements for the day.&nbsp; It was the time fixed for
the meeting of the Imperial Association at Corvsgate Castle, the celebrated
ruin five miles off, and the meeting had some fascinations for her.&nbsp;
For one thing, she had never been present at a gathering of the kind,
although what was left in any shape from the past was her constant interest,
because it recalled her to herself and fortified her mind.&nbsp; Persons
waging a harassing social fight are apt in the interest of the combat
to forget the smallness of the end in view; and the hints that perishing
historical remnants afforded her of the attenuating effects of time
even upon great struggles corrected the apparent scale of her own.&nbsp;
She was reminded that in a strife for such a ludicrously small object
as the entry of drawing-rooms, winning, equally with losing, is below
the zero of the true philosopher&rsquo;s concern.</p>
<p>There could never be a more excellent reason than this for going
to view the meagre stumps remaining from flourishing bygone centuries,
and it had weight with Ethelberta this very day; but it would be difficult
to state the whole composition of her motive.&nbsp; The approaching
meeting had been one of the great themes at Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s dinner-party,
and Lord Mountclere, on learning that she was to be at Knollsea, had
recommended her attendance at some, if not all of the meetings, as a
desirable and exhilarating change after her laborious season&rsquo;s
work in town.&nbsp; It was pleasant to have won her way so far in high
places that her health of body and mind should be thus considered&mdash;pleasant,
less as personal gratification, than that it casually reflected a proof
of her good judgment in a course which everybody among her kindred had
condemned by calling a foolhardy undertaking.</p>
<p>And she might go without the restraint of ceremony.&nbsp; Unconventionality&mdash;almost
eccentricity&mdash;was <i>de rigueur</i> for one who had been first
heard of as a poetess; from whose red lips magic romance had since trilled
for weeks to crowds of listeners, as from a perennial spring.</p>
<p>So Ethelberta went, after a considerable pondering how to get there
without the needless sacrifice either of dignity or cash.&nbsp; It would
be inconsiderate to the children to spend a pound on a brougham when
as much as she could spare was wanted for their holiday.&nbsp; It was
almost too far too walk.&nbsp; She had, however, decided to walk, when
she met a boy with a donkey, who offered to lend it to her for three
shillings.&nbsp; The animal was rather sad-looking, but Ethelberta found
she could sit upon the pad without discomfort.&nbsp; Considering that
she might pull up some distance short of the castle, and leave the ass
at a cottage before joining her four-wheeled friends, she struck the
bargain and rode on her way.</p>
<p>This was, first by a path on the shore where the tide dragged huskily
up and down the shingle without disturbing it, and thence up the steep
crest of land opposite, whereon she lingered awhile to let the ass breathe.&nbsp;
On one of the spires of chalk into which the hill here had been split
was perched a cormorant, silent and motionless, with wings spread out
to dry in the sun after his morning&rsquo;s fishing, their white surface
shining like mail.&nbsp; Retiring without disturbing him and turning
to the left along the lofty ridge which ran inland, the country on each
side lay beneath her like a map, domains behind domains, parishes by
the score, harbours, fir-woods, and little inland seas mixing curiously
together.&nbsp; Thence she ambled along through a huge cemetery of barrows,
containing human dust from prehistoric times.</p>
<p>Standing on the top of a giant&rsquo;s grave in this antique land,
Ethelberta lifted her eyes to behold two sorts of weather pervading
Nature at the same time.&nbsp; Far below on the right hand it was a
fine day, and the silver sunbeams lighted up a many-armed inland sea
which stretched round an island with fir-trees and gorse, and amid brilliant
crimson heaths wherein white paths and roads occasionally met the eye
in dashes and zigzags like flashes of lightning.&nbsp; Outside, where
the broad Channel appeared, a berylline and opalized variegation of
ripples, currents, deeps, and shallows, lay as fair under the sun as
a New Jerusalem, the shores being of gleaming sand.&nbsp; Upon the radiant
heather bees and butterflies were busy, she knew, and the birds on that
side were just beginning their autumn songs.</p>
<p>On the left, quite up to her position, was dark and cloudy weather,
shading a valley of heavy greens and browns, which at its further side
rose to meet the sea in tall cliffs, suggesting even here at their back
how terrible were their aspects seaward in a growling southwest gale.&nbsp;
Here grassed hills rose like knuckles gloved in dark olive, and little
plantations between them formed a still deeper and sadder monochrome.&nbsp;
A zinc sky met a leaden sea on this hand, the low wind groaned and whined,
and not a bird sang.</p>
<p>The ridge along which Ethelberta rode divided these two climates
like a wall; it soon became apparent that they were wrestling for mastery
immediately in her pathway.&nbsp; The issue long remained doubtful,
and this being an imaginative hour with her, she watched as typical
of her own fortunes how the front of battle swayed&mdash;now to the
west, flooding her with sun, now to the east, covering her with shade:
then the wind moved round to the north, a blue hole appeared in the
overhanging cloud, at about the place of the north star; and the sunlight
spread on both sides of her.</p>
<p>The towers of the notable ruin to be visited rose out of the furthermost
shoulder of the upland as she advanced, its site being the slope and
crest of a smoothly nibbled mount at the toe of the ridge she had followed.&nbsp;
When observing the previous uncertainty of the weather on this side
Ethelberta had been led to doubt if the meeting would be held here to-day,
and she was now strengthened in her opinion that it would not by the
total absence of human figures amid the ruins, though the time of appointment
was past.&nbsp; This disposed of another question which had perplexed
her: where to find a stable for the ass during the meeting, for she
had scarcely liked the idea of facing the whole body of lords and gentlemen
upon the animal&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; She now decided to retain her seat,
ride round the ruin, and go home again, without troubling further about
the movements of the Association or acquaintance with the members composing
it.</p>
<p>Accordingly Ethelberta crossed the bridge over the moat, and rode
under the first archway into the outer ward.&nbsp; As she had expected,
not a soul was here.&nbsp; The arrow-slits, portcullis-grooves, and
staircases met her eye as familiar friends, for in her childhood she
had once paid a visit to the spot.&nbsp; Ascending the green incline
and through another arch into the second ward, she still pressed on,
till at last the ass was unable to clamber an inch further.&nbsp; Here
she dismounted, and tying him to a stone which projected like a fang
from a raw edge of wall, performed the remainder of the ascent on foot.&nbsp;
Once among the towers above, she became so interested in the windy corridors,
mildewed dungeons, and the tribe of daws peering invidiously upon her
from overhead, that she forgot the flight of time.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of an hour passed before she came out from
the immense walls, and looked from an opening to the front over the
wide expanse of the outer ward, by which she had ascended.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was taken aback to see there a file of shining carriages,
which had arrived during her seclusion in the keep.&nbsp; From these
began to burst a miscellany of many-coloured draperies, blue, buff,
pied, and black; they united into one, and crept up the incline like
a cloud, which then parted into fragments, dived into old doorways,
and lost substance behind projecting piles.&nbsp; Recognizing in this
the ladies and gentlemen of the meeting, her first thought was how to
escape, for she was suddenly overcome with dread to meet them all single-handed
as she stood.&nbsp; She drew back and hurried round to the side, as
the laughter and voices of the assembly began to be audible, and, more
than ever vexed that she could not have fallen in with them in some
unobtrusive way, Ethelberta found that they were immediately beneath
her.</p>
<p>Venturing to peep forward again, what was her mortification at finding
them gathered in a ring, round no object of interest belonging to the
ruin, but round her faithful beast, who had loosened himself in some
way from the stone, and stood in the middle of a plat of grass, placidly
regarding them.</p>
<p>Being now in the teeth of the Association, there was nothing to do
but to go on, since, if she did not, the next few steps of their advance
would disclose her.&nbsp; She made the best of it, and began to descend
in the broad view of the assembly, from the midst of which proceeded
a laugh&mdash;&lsquo;Hee-hee-hee!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ethelberta knew that
Lord Mountclere was there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor thing has strayed from its owner,&rsquo; said one
lady, as they all stood eyeing the apparition of the ass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may belong to some of the villagers,&rsquo; said the President
in a historical voice: &lsquo;and it may be appropriate to mention that
many were kept here in olden times: they were largely used as beasts
of burden in victualling the castle previous to the last siege, in the
year sixteen hundred and forty-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very weary, and has come a long way, I think,&rsquo;
said a lady; adding, in an imaginative tone, &lsquo;the humble creature
looks so aged and is so quaintly saddled that we may suppose it to be
only an animated relic, of the same date as the other remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time Lord Mountclere had noticed Ethelberta&rsquo;s presence,
and straightening himself to ten years younger, he lifted his hat in
answer to her smile, and came up jauntily.&nbsp; It was a good time
now to see what the viscount was really like.&nbsp; He appeared to be
about sixty-five, and the dignified aspect which he wore to a gazer
at a distance became depreciated to jocund slyness upon nearer view,
when the small type could be read between the leading lines.&nbsp; Then
it could be seen that his upper lip dropped to a point in the middle,
as if impressing silence upon his too demonstrative lower one.&nbsp;
His right and left profiles were different, one corner of his mouth
being more compressed than the other, producing a deep line thence downwards
to the side of his chin.&nbsp; Each eyebrow rose obliquely outwards
and upwards, and was thus far above the little eye, shining with the
clearness of a pond that has just been able to weather the heats of
summer.&nbsp; Below this was a preternaturally fat jowl, which, by thrusting
against cheeks and chin, caused the arch old mouth to be almost buried
at the corners.</p>
<p>A few words of greeting passed, and Ethelberta told him how she was
fearing to meet them all, united and primed with their morning&rsquo;s
knowledge as they appeared to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we have not done much yet,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As for myself, I have given no thought at all to our day&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; I had not forgotten your promise to attend, if you could
possibly drive across, and&mdash;hee-hee-hee!&mdash;I have frequently
looked towards the hill where the road descends. . . .&nbsp; Will you
now permit me to introduce some of my party&mdash;as many of them as
you care to know by name?&nbsp; I think they would all like to speak
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta then found herself nominally made known to ten or a dozen
ladies and gentlemen who had wished for special acquaintance with her.&nbsp;
She stood there, as all women stand who have made themselves remarkable
by their originality, or devotion to any singular cause, as a person
freed of her hampering and inconvenient sex, and, by virtue of her popularity,
unfettered from the conventionalities of manner prescribed by custom
for household womankind.&nbsp; The charter to move abroad unchaperoned,
which society for good reasons grants only to women of three sorts&mdash;the
famous, the ministering, and the improper&mdash;Ethelberta was in a
fair way to make splendid use of: instead of walking in protected lanes
she experienced that luxury of isolation which normally is enjoyed by
men alone, in conjunction with the attention naturally bestowed on a
woman young and fair.&nbsp; Among the presentations were Mr. and Mrs.
Tynn, member and member&rsquo;s mainspring for North Wessex; Sir Cyril
and Lady Blandsbury; Lady Jane Joy; and the Honourable Edgar Mountclere,
the viscount&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; There also hovered near her the
learned Doctor Yore; Mr. Small, a profound writer, who never printed
his works; the Reverend Mr. Brook, rector; the Very Reverend Dr. Taylor,
dean; and the undoubtedly Reverend Mr. Tinkleton, Nonconformist, who
had slipped into the fold by chance.</p>
<p>These and others looked with interest at Ethelberta: the old county
fathers hard, as at a questionable town phenomenon, the county sons
tenderly, as at a pretty creature, and the county daughters with great
admiration, as at a lady reported by their mammas to be no better than
she should be.&nbsp; It will be seen that Ethelberta was the sort of
woman that well-rooted local people might like to look at on such a
free and friendly occasion as an archaeological meeting, where, to gratify
a pleasant whim, the picturesque form of acquaintance is for the nonce
preferred to the useful, the spirits being so brisk as to swerve from
strict attention to the select and sequent gifts of heaven, blood and
acres, to consider for an idle moment the subversive Mephistophelian
endowment, brains.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our progress in the survey of the castle has not been far
as yet,&rsquo; Lord Mountclere resumed; &lsquo;indeed, we have only
just arrived, the weather this morning being so unsettled.&nbsp; When
you came up we were engaged in a preliminary study of the poor animal
you see there: how it could have got up here we cannot understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed as he spoke to the donkey which had brought Ethelberta
thither, whereupon she was silent, and gazed at her untoward beast as
if she had never before beheld him.</p>
<p>The ass looked at Ethelberta as though he would say, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you own me, after safely bringing you over those weary hills?&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the pride and emulation which had made her what she was would not
permit her, as the most lovely woman there, to take upon her own shoulders
the ridicule that had already been cast upon the ass.&nbsp; Had he been
young and gaily caparisoned, she might have done it; but his age, the
clumsy trappings of rustic make, and his needy woful look of hard servitude,
were too much to endure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many come and picnic here,&rsquo; she said serenely, &lsquo;and
the animal may have been left till they return from some walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere, without the slightest suspicion
of the truth.&nbsp; The humble ass hung his head in his usual manner,
and it demanded little fancy from Ethelberta to imagine that he despised
her.&nbsp; And then her mind flew back to her history and extraction,
to her father&mdash;perhaps at that moment inventing a private plate-powder
in an underground pantry&mdash;and with a groan at her inconsistency
in being ashamed of the ass, she said in her heart, &lsquo;My God, what
a thing am I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They then all moved on to another part of the castle, the viscount
busying himself round and round her person like the head scraper at
a pig-killing; and as they went indiscriminately mingled, jesting lightly
or talking in earnest, she beheld ahead of her the form of Neigh among
the rest.</p>
<p>Now, there could only be one reason on earth for Neigh&rsquo;s presence&mdash;her
remark that she might attend&mdash;for Neigh took no more interest in
antiquities than in the back of the moon.&nbsp; Ethelberta was a little
flurried; perhaps he had come to scold her, or to treat her badly in
that indefinable way of his by which he could make a woman feel as nothing
without any direct act at all.&nbsp; She was afraid of him, and, determining
to shun him, was thankful that Lord Mountclere was near, to take off
the edge of Neigh&rsquo;s manner towards her if he approached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know in what part of the ruins the lecture is to be
given?&rsquo; she said to the viscount.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherever you like,&rsquo; he replied gallantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
you propose a place, and I will get Dr. Yore to adopt it.&nbsp; Say,
shall it be here, or where they are standing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>How could Ethelberta refrain from exercising a little power when
it was put into her hands in this way?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if it makes no difference
to the meeting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It shall be,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>And then the lively old nobleman skipped like a roe to the President
and to Dr. Yore, who was to read the paper on the castle, and they soon
appeared coming back to where the viscount&rsquo;s party and Ethelberta
were beginning to seat themselves.&nbsp; The bulk of the company followed,
and Dr. Yore began.</p>
<p>He must have had a countenance of leather&mdash;as, indeed, from
his colour he appeared to have&mdash;to stand unmoved in his position,
and read, and look up to give explanations, without a change of muscle,
under the dozens of bright eyes that were there converged upon him,
like the sticks of a fan, from the ladies who sat round him in a semicircle
upon the grass.&nbsp; However, he went on calmly, and the women sheltered
themselves from the heat with their umbrellas and sunshades, their ears
lulled by the hum of insects, and by the drone of the doctor&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; The reader buzzed on with the history of the castle, tracing
its development from a mound with a few earthworks to its condition
in Norman times; he related monkish marvels connected with the spot;
its resistance under Matilda to Stephen, its probable shape while a
residence of King John, and the sad story of the Damsel of Brittany,
sister of his victim Arthur, who was confined here in company with the
two daughters of Alexander, king of Scotland.&nbsp; He went on to recount
the confinement of Edward II. herein, previous to his murder at Berkeley,
the gay doings in the reign of Elizabeth, and so downward through time
to the final overthrow of the stern old pile.&nbsp; As he proceeded,
the lecturer pointed with his finger at the various features appertaining
to the date of his story, which he told with splendid vigour when he
had warmed to his work, till his narrative, particularly in the conjectural
and romantic parts, where it became coloured rather by the speaker&rsquo;s
imagination than by the pigments of history, gathered together the wandering
thoughts of all.&nbsp; It was easy for him then to meet those fair concentred
eyes, when the sunshades were thrown back, and complexions forgotten,
in the interest of the history.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s face was then
no longer criticized as a rugged boulder, a dried fig, an oak carving,
or a walnut shell, but became blotted out like a mountain top in a shining
haze by the nebulous pictures conjured by his tale.</p>
<p>Then the lecture ended, and questions were asked, and individuals
of the company wandered at will, the light dresses of the ladies sweeping
over the hot grass and brushing up thistledown which had hitherto lain
quiescent, so that it rose in a flight from the skirts of each like
a comet&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>Some of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s party, including himself and Ethelberta,
wandered now into a cool dungeon, partly open to the air overhead, where
long arms of ivy hung between their eyes and the white sky.&nbsp; While
they were here, Lady Jane Joy and some other friends of the viscount
told Ethelberta that they were probably coming on to Knollsea.</p>
<p>She instantly perceived that getting into close quarters in that
way might be very inconvenient, considering the youngsters she had under
her charge, and straightway decided upon a point that she had debated
for several days&mdash;a visit to her aunt in Normandy.&nbsp; In London
it had been a mere thought, but the Channel had looked so tempting from
its brink that the journey was virtually fixed as soon as she reached
Knollsea, and found that a little pleasure steamer crossed to Cherbourg
once a week during the summer, so that she would not have to enter the
crowded routes at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I shall not see you in Knollsea,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am about to go to Cherbourg and then to Rouen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How sorry I am.&nbsp; When do you leave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the beginning of next week,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, settling
the time there and then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I hear you say that you were going to Cherbourg and Rouen?&rsquo;
Lord Mountclere inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think to do so,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to Normandy myself,&rsquo; said a voice behind
her, and without turning she knew that Neigh was standing there.</p>
<p>They next went outside, and Lord Mountclere offered Ethelberta his
arm on the ground of assisting her down the burnished grass slope.&nbsp;
Ethelberta, taking pity upon him, took it; but the assistance was all
on her side; she stood like a statue amid his slips and totterings,
some of which taxed her strength heavily, and her ingenuity more, to
appear as the supported and not the supporter.&nbsp; The incident brought
Neigh still further from his retirement, and she learnt that he was
one of a yachting party which had put in at Knollsea that morning; she
was greatly relieved to find that he was just now on his way to London,
whence he would probably proceed on his journey abroad.</p>
<p>Ethelberta adhered as well as she could to her resolve that Neigh
should not speak with her alone, but by dint of perseverance he did
manage to address her without being overheard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you give me an answer?&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have come on purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot just now.&nbsp; I have been led to doubt you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubt me?&nbsp; What new wrong have I done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spoken jestingly of my visit to Farnfield.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good ---!&nbsp; I did not speak or think of you.&nbsp; When
I told that incident I had no idea who the lady was&mdash;I did not
know it was you till two days later, and I at once held my tongue.&nbsp;
I vow to you upon my soul and life that what I say is true.&nbsp; How
shall I prove my truth better than by my errand here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of this now.&nbsp; I am so occupied with
other things.&nbsp; I am going to Rouen, and will think of it on my
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going there too.&nbsp; When do you go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be in Rouen next Wednesday, I hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&ocirc;tel Beau S&eacute;jour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you give me an answer there?&nbsp; I can easily call
upon you.&nbsp; It is now a month and more since you first led me to
hope&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not lead you to hope&mdash;at any rate clearly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indirectly you did.&nbsp; And although I am willing to be
as considerate as any man ought to be in giving you time to think over
the question, there is a limit to my patience.&nbsp; Any necessary delay
I will put up with, but I won&rsquo;t be trifled with.&nbsp; I hate
all nonsense, and can&rsquo;t stand it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&nbsp; Good morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Mrs. Petherwin&mdash;just one word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will meet you at Rouen for an answer.&nbsp; I would meet
you in Hades for the matter of that.&nbsp; Remember this: next Wednesday,
if I live, I shall call upon you at Rouen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not say nay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I?&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But say it shall be an appointment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere was by this time toddling towards them to ask if
they would come on to his house, Enckworth Court, not very far distant,
to lunch with the rest of the party.&nbsp; Neigh, having already arranged
to go on to town that afternoon, was obliged to decline, and Ethelberta
thought fit to do the same, idly asking Lord Mountclere if Enckworth
Court lay in the direction of a gorge that was visible where they stood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; considerably to the left,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
opening you are looking at would reveal the sea if it were not for the
trees that block the way.&nbsp; Ah, those trees have a history; they
are half-a-dozen elms which I planted myself when I was a boy.&nbsp;
How time flies!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is unfortunate they stand just so as to cover the blue
bit of sea.&nbsp; That addition would double the value of the view from
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would prefer the blue sea to the trees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that particular spot I should; they might have looked just
as well, and yet have hidden nothing worth seeing.&nbsp; The narrow
slit would have been invaluable there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shall fall before the sun sets, in deference to your
opinion,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would be rash indeed,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, laughing,
&lsquo;when my opinion on such a point may be worth nothing whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where no other is acted upon, it is practically the universal
one,&rsquo; he replied gaily.</p>
<p>And then Ethelberta&rsquo;s elderly admirer bade her adieu, and away
the whole party drove in a long train over the hills towards the valley
wherein stood Enckworth Court.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s carriage was
supposed by her friends to have been left at the village inn, as were
many others, and her retiring from view on foot attracted no notice.</p>
<p>She watched them out of sight, and she also saw the rest depart&mdash;those
who, their interest in archaeology having begun and ended with this
spot, had, like herself, declined the hospitable viscount&rsquo;s invitation,
and started to drive or walk at once home again.&nbsp; Thereupon the
castle was quite deserted except by Ethelberta, the ass, and the jackdaws,
now floundering at ease again in and about the ivy of the keep.</p>
<p>Not wishing to enter Knollsea till the evening shades were falling,
she still walked amid the ruins, examining more leisurely some points
which the stress of keeping herself companionable would not allow her
to attend to while the assemblage was present.&nbsp; At the end of the
survey, being somewhat weary with her clambering, she sat down on the
slope commanding the gorge where the trees grew, to make a pencil sketch
of the landscape as it was revealed between the ragged walls.&nbsp;
Thus engaged she weighed the circumstances of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
invitation, and could not be certain if it were prudishness or simple
propriety in herself which had instigated her to refuse.&nbsp; She would
have liked the visit for many reasons, and if Lord Mountclere had been
anybody but a remarkably attentive old widower, she would have gone.&nbsp;
As it was, it had occurred to her that there was something in his tone
which should lead her to hesitate.&nbsp; Were any among the elderly
or married ladies who had appeared upon the ground in a detached form
as she had done&mdash;and many had appeared thus&mdash;invited to Enckworth;
and if not, why were they not?&nbsp; That Lord Mountclere admired her
there was no doubt, and for this reason it behoved her to be careful.&nbsp;
His disappointment at parting from her was, in one aspect, simply laughable,
from its odd resemblance to the unfeigned sorrow of a boy of fifteen
at a first parting from his first love; in another aspect it caused
reflection; and she thought again of his curiosity about her doings
for the remainder of the summer.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>While she sketched and thought thus, the shadows grew longer, and
the sun low.&nbsp; And then she perceived a movement in the gorge.&nbsp;
One of the trees forming the curtain across it began to wave strangely:
it went further to one side, and fell. Where the tree had stood was
now a rent in the foliage, and through the narrow rent could be seen
the distant sea.</p>
<p>Ethelberta uttered a soft exclamation.&nbsp; It was not caused by
the surprise she had felt, nor by the intrinsic interest of the sight,
nor by want of comprehension.&nbsp; It was a sudden realization of vague
things hitherto dreamed of from a distance only&mdash;a sense of novel
power put into her hands without request or expectation.&nbsp; A landscape
was to be altered to suit her whim.&nbsp; She had in her lifetime moved
essentially larger mountains, but they had seemed of far less splendid
material than this; for it was the nature of the gratification rather
than its magnitude which enchanted the fancy of a woman whose poetry,
in spite of her necessities, was hardly yet extinguished.&nbsp; But
there was something more, with which poetry had little to do.&nbsp;
Whether the opinion of any pretty woman in England was of more weight
with Lord Mountclere than memories of his boyhood, or whether that distinction
was reserved for her alone; this was a point that she would have liked
to know.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of power in a new element, an enjoyment somewhat resembling
in kind that which is given by a first ride or swim, held Ethelberta
to the spot, and she waited, but sketched no more.&nbsp; Another tree-top
swayed and vanished as before, and the slit of sea was larger still.&nbsp;
Her mind and eye were so occupied with this matter that, sitting in
her nook, she did not observe a thin young man, his boots white with
the dust of a long journey on foot, who arrived at the castle by the
valley-road from Knollsea.&nbsp; He looked awhile at the ruin, and,
skirting its flank instead of entering by the great gateway, climbed
up the scarp and walked in through a breach.&nbsp; After standing for
a moment among the walls, now silent and apparently empty, with a disappointed
look he descended the slope, and proceeded along on his way.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, who was in quite another part of the castle, saw the
black spot diminishing to the size of a fly as he receded along the
dusty road, and soon after she descended on the other side, where she
remounted the ass, and ambled homeward as she had come, in no bright
mood.&nbsp; What, seeing the precariousness of her state, was the day&rsquo;s
triumph worth after all, unless, before her beauty abated, she could
ensure her position against the attacks of chance?</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To be thus is nothing;<br />
But to be safely thus.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;she said it more than once on her journey that day.</p>
<p>On entering the sitting-room of their cot up the hill she found it
empty, and from a change perceptible in the position of small articles
of furniture, something unusual seemed to have taken place in her absence.&nbsp;
The dwelling being of that sort in which whatever goes on in one room
is audible through all the rest, Picotee, who was upstairs, heard the
arrival and came down.&nbsp; Picotee&rsquo;s face was rosed over with
the brilliance of some excitement.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you think I
have to tell you, Berta?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no idea,&rsquo; said her sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo;
she added, her face intensifying to a wan sadness, &lsquo;Mr. Julian
has not been here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;And we went down to
the sands&mdash;he, and Myrtle, and Georgina, and Emmeline, and I&mdash;and
Cornelia came down when she had put away the dinner.&nbsp; And then
we dug wriggles out of the sand with Myrtle&rsquo;s spade: we got such
a lot, and had such fun; they are in a dish in the kitchen.&nbsp; Mr.
Julian came to see you; but at last he could wait no longer, and when
I told him you were at the meeting in the castle ruins he said he would
try to find you there on his way home, if he could get there before
the meeting broke up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it was he I saw far away on the road&mdash;yes, it must
have been.&rsquo;&nbsp; She remained in gloomy reverie a few moments,
and then said, &lsquo;Very well&mdash;let it be.&nbsp; Picotee, get
me some tea: I do not want dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the news of Christopher&rsquo;s visit seemed to have taken away
her appetite for tea also, and after sitting a little while she flung
herself down upon the couch, and told Picotee that she had settled to
go and see their aunt Charlotte.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to write to Sol and Dan to ask them to meet me
there,&rsquo; she added.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want them, if possible, to see
Paris.&nbsp; It will improve them greatly in their trades, I am thinking,
if they can see the kinds of joinery and decoration practised in France.&nbsp;
They agreed to go, if I should wish it, before we left London.&nbsp;
You, of course, will go as my maid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee gazed upon the sea with a crestfallen look, as if she would
rather not cross it in any capacity just then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would scarcely be worth going to the expense of taking
me, would it?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>The cause of Picotee&rsquo;s sudden sense of economy was so plain
that her sister smiled; but young love, however foolish, is to a thinking
person far too tragic a power for ridicule; and Ethelberta forbore,
going on as if Picotee had not spoken: &lsquo;I must have you with me.&nbsp;
I may be seen there: so many are passing through Rouen at this time
of the year.&nbsp; Cornelia can take excellent care of the children
while we are gone.&nbsp; I want to get out of England, and I will get
out of England.&nbsp; There is nothing but vanity and vexation here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you were away when he called,&rsquo; said Picotee
gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mean that.&nbsp; I wish there were no different
ranks in the world, and that contrivance were not a necessary faculty
to have at all.&nbsp; Well, we are going to cross by the little steamer
that puts in here, and we are going on Monday.&rsquo;&nbsp; She added
in another minute, &lsquo;What had Mr. Julian to tell us that he came
here?&nbsp; How did he find us out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mentioned that we were coming here in my letter to Faith.&nbsp;
Mr. Julian says that perhaps he and his sister may also come for a few
days before the season is over.&nbsp; I should like to see Miss Julian
again.&nbsp; She is such a nice girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ethelberta played with her hair, and looked
at the ceiling as she reclined.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have decided after all,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;that it will be better to take Cornelia as my maid,
and leave you here with the children.&nbsp; Cornelia is stronger as
a companion than you, and she will be delighted to go.&nbsp; Do you
think you are competent to keep Myrtle and Georgina out of harm&rsquo;s
way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;I will be exceedingly careful,&rsquo; said Picotee,
with great vivacity.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if there is time I can go on teaching
them a little.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Picotee caught Ethelberta&rsquo;s eye,
and colouring red, sank down beside her sister, whispering, &lsquo;I
know why it is!&nbsp; But if you would rather have me with you I will
go, and not once wish to stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta looked as if she knew all about that, and said, &lsquo;Of
course there will be no necessity to tell the Julians about my departure
until they have fixed the time for coming, and cannot alter their minds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the children with Cornelia, and their appearance outside
the window, pushing between the fuchsia bushes which overhung the path,
put an end to this dialogue; they entered armed with buckets and spades,
a very moist and sandy aspect pervading them as far up as the high-water
mark of their clothing, and began to tell Ethelberta of the wonders
of the deep.</p>
<h2>32. A ROOM IN ENCKWORTH COURT</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure the report is true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure that what I say is true, my lord; but it is hardly
to be called a report.&nbsp; It is a secret, known at present to nobody
but myself and Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s maid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s trusty valet, and the conversation
was between him and the viscount in a dressing-room at Enckworth Court,
on the evening after the meeting of archaeologists at Corvsgate Castle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m-h&rsquo;m; the daughter of a butler.&nbsp; Does
Mrs. Doncastle know of this yet, or Mr. Neigh, or any of their friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite positive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite positive.&nbsp; I was, by accident, the first that Mrs.
Menlove named the matter to, and I told her it might be much to her
advantage if she took particular care it should go no further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Menlove!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady&rsquo;s-maid at Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, ah&mdash;of course.&nbsp; You may leave me now, Tipman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Lord Mountclere remained in thought for a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;A clever
little puss, to hoodwink us all like this&mdash;hee-hee!&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Her education&mdash;how finished; and her beauty&mdash;so seldom
that I meet with such a woman.&nbsp; Cut down my elms to please a butler&rsquo;s
daughter&mdash;what a joke&mdash;certainly a good joke!&nbsp; To interest
me in her on the right side instead of the wrong was strange.&nbsp;
But it can be made to change sides&mdash;hee-hee!&mdash;it can be made
to change sides!&nbsp; Tipman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tipman came forward from the doorway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you take care that that piece of gossip you mentioned
to me is not repeated in this house?&nbsp; I strongly disapprove of
talebearing of any sort, and wish to hear no more of this.&nbsp; Such
stories are never true.&nbsp; Answer me&mdash;do you hear?&nbsp; Such
stories are never true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg pardon, but I think your lordship will find this one
true,&rsquo; said the valet quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then where did she get her manners and education?&nbsp; Do
you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not, my lord.&nbsp; I suppose she picked &rsquo;em up
by her wits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind what you suppose,&rsquo; said the old man impatiently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Whenever I ask a question of you tell me what you know, and no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so, my lord.&nbsp; I beg your lordship&rsquo;s pardon
for supposing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m-h&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Have the fashion-books and plates
arrived yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Le Follet</i> has, my lord; but not the others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me have it at once.&nbsp; Always bring it to me at once.&nbsp;
Are there any handsome ones this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are much the same class of female as usual, I think,
my lord,&rsquo; said Tipman, fetching the paper and laying it before
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they are,&rsquo; said the viscount, leaning back and
scrutinizing the faces of the women one by one, and talking softly to
himself in a way that had grown upon him as his age increased.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet they are very well: that one with her shoulder turned is
pure and charming&mdash;the brown-haired one will pass.&nbsp; All very
harmless and innocent, but without character; no soul, or inspiration,
or eloquence of eye.&nbsp; What an eye was hers!&nbsp; There is not
a girl among them so beautiful. . . .&nbsp; Tipman!&nbsp; Come and take
it away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I will subscribe to these papers
any longer&mdash;how long have I subscribed?&nbsp; Never mind&mdash;I
take no interest in these things, and I suppose I must give them up.&nbsp;
What white article is that I see on the floor yonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can see nothing, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, you can.&nbsp; At the other end of the room.&nbsp;
It is a white handkerchief.&nbsp; Bring it to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg pardon, my lord, but I cannot see any white handkerchief.&nbsp;
Whereabouts does your lordship mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There in the corner.&nbsp; If it is not a handkerchief, what
is it?&nbsp; Walk along till you come to it&mdash;that is it; now a
little further&mdash;now your foot is against it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O that&mdash;it is not anything.&nbsp; It is the light reflected
against the skirting, so that it looks like a white patch of something&mdash;that
is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m-hm.&nbsp; My eyes&mdash;how weak they are!&nbsp;
I am getting old, that&rsquo;s what it is: I am an old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, an old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we shall all be old some day, and so will your lordship,
I suppose; but as yet&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you I am an old man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my lord&mdash;I did not mean to contradict.&nbsp; An
old man in one sense&mdash;old in a young man&rsquo;s sense, but not
in a house-of-parliament or historical sense.&nbsp; A little oldish&mdash;I
meant that, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may be an old man in one sense or in another sense in your
mind; but let me tell you there are men older than I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so there are, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People may call me what they please, and you may be impertinent
enough to repeat to me what they say, but let me tell you I am not a
very old man after all.&nbsp; I am not an old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old in knowledge of the world I meant, my lord, not in years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes.&nbsp; Experience of course I cannot be without.&nbsp;
And I like what is beautiful.&nbsp; Tipman, you must go to Knollsea;
don&rsquo;t send, but go yourself, as I wish nobody else to be concerned
in this.&nbsp; Go to Knollsea, and find out when the steamboat for Cherbourg
starts; and when you have done that, I shall want you to send Taylor
to me.&nbsp; I wish Captain Strong to bring the <i>Fawn</i> round into
Knollsea Bay.&nbsp; Next week I may want you to go to Cherbourg in the
yacht with me&mdash;if the Channel is pretty calm&mdash;and then perhaps
to Rouen and Paris.&nbsp; But I will speak of that to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meanwhile I recommend that you and Mrs. Menlove repeat nothing
you may have heard concerning the lady you just now spoke of.&nbsp;
Here is a slight present for Mrs. Menlove; and accept this for yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He handed money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your lordship may be sure we will not,&rsquo; the valet replied.</p>
<h2>33. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL&mdash;NORMANDY</h2>
<p>On Monday morning the little steamer <i>Speedwell</i> made her appearance
round the promontory by Knollsea Bay, to take in passengers for the
transit to Cherbourg.&nbsp; Breezes the freshest that could blow without
verging on keenness flew over the quivering deeps and shallows; and
the sunbeams pierced every detail of barrow, path and rabbit-run upon
the lofty convexity of down and waste which shut in Knollsea from the
world to the west.</p>
<p>They left the pier at eight o&rsquo;clock, taking at first a short
easterly course to avoid a sinister ledge of limestones jutting from
the water like crocodile&rsquo;s teeth, which first obtained notoriety
in English history through being the spot whereon a formidable Danish
fleet went to pieces a thousand years ago.&nbsp; At the moment that
the <i>Speedwell</i> turned to enter upon the direct course, a schooner-yacht,
whose sheets gleamed like bridal satin, loosed from a remoter part of
the bay; continuing to bear off, she cut across the steamer&rsquo;s
wake, and took a course almost due southerly, which was precisely that
of the <i>Speedwell</i>.&nbsp; The wind was very favourable for the
yacht, blowing a few points from north in a steady pressure on her quarter,
and, having been built with every modern appliance that shipwrights
could offer, the schooner found no difficulty in getting abreast, and
even ahead, of the steamer, as soon as she had escaped the shelter of
the hills.</p>
<p>The more or less parallel courses of the vessels continued for some
time without causing any remark among the people on board the <i>Speedwell</i>.&nbsp;
At length one noticed the fact, and another; and then it became the
general topic of conversation in the group upon the bridge, where Ethelberta,
her hair getting frizzed and her cheeks carnationed by the wind, sat
upon a camp-stool looking towards the prow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is bound for Guernsey,&rsquo; said one.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
half-an-hour she will put about for a more westerly course, you&rsquo;ll
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not for Guernsey or anywhere that way,&rsquo; said
an acquaintance, looking through his glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;If she is out
for anything more than a morning cruise, she is bound for our port.&nbsp;
I should not wonder if she is crossing to get stocked, as most of them
do, to save the duty on her wine and provisions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know whose yacht it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta looked at the light leaning figure of the pretty schooner,
which seemed to skate along upon her bilge and make white shavings of
all the sea that touched her.&nbsp; She at first imagined that this
might be the yacht Neigh had arrived in at the end of the previous week,
for she knew that he came as one of a yachting party, and she had noticed
no other boat of that sort in the bay since his arrival.&nbsp; But as
all his party had gone ashore and not yet returned, she was surprised
to see the supposed vessel here.&nbsp; To add to her perplexity, she
could not be positive, now that it came to a real nautical query, whether
the craft of Neigh&rsquo;s friends had one mast or two, for she had
caught but a fragmentary view of the topsail over the apple-trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that the yacht which has been lying at Knollsea for the
last few days?&rsquo; she inquired of the master of the <i>Speedwell</i>,
as soon as she had an opportunity.</p>
<p>The master warmed beneath his copper-coloured rind.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
no, miss; that one you saw was a cutter&mdash;a smaller boat altogether,&rsquo;
he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Built on the sliding-keel principle, you understand,
miss&mdash;and red below her water-line, if you noticed.&nbsp; This
is Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s yacht&mdash;the Fawn.&nbsp; You might have
seen her re&rsquo;ching in round Old-Harry Rock this morning afore we
started.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;a nobleman of this neighbourhood.&nbsp; But he don&rsquo;t
do so much at yachting as he used to in his younger days.&nbsp; I believe
he&rsquo;s aboard this morning, however.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta now became more absorbed than ever in their ocean comrade,
and watched its motions continually.&nbsp; The schooner was considerably
in advance of them by this time, and seemed to be getting by degrees
out of their course.&nbsp; She wondered if Lord Mountclere could be
really going to Cherbourg: if so, why had he said nothing about the
trip to her when she spoke of her own approaching voyage thither?&nbsp;
The yacht changed its character in her eyes; losing the indefinite interest
of the unknown, it acquired the charm of a riddle on motives, of which
the alternatives were, had Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s journey anything
to do with her own, or had it not?&nbsp; Common probability pointed
to the latter supposition; but the time of starting, the course of the
yacht, and recollections of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s homage, suggested
the more extraordinary possibility.</p>
<p>She went across to Cornelia.&nbsp; &lsquo;The man who handed us on
board&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I see him speaking to you this morning?&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Cornelia.&nbsp; &lsquo;He asked if my mistress
was the popular Mrs. Petherwin?</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you told him, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What made you do that, Cornelia?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I might: I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; When I
went through the toll-gate, such a gentlemanly-looking man asked me
if he should help me to carry the things to the end of the pier; and
as we went on together he said he supposed me to be Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s
maid.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two men met afterwards,
so there would ha&rsquo; been no good in my denying it to one of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was this gentlemanly person?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I asked the other man that, and he told me one of Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
upper servants.&nbsp; I knew then there was no harm in having been civil
to him.&nbsp; He is well-mannered, and talks splendid language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That yacht you see on our right hand is Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; If I do not mistake, we shall have her closer by-and-by,
and you may meet your gentlemanly friend again.&nbsp; Be careful how
you talk to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta sat down, thought of the meeting at Corvsgate Castle,
of the dinner-party at Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s, of the strange position
she had there been in, and then of her father.&nbsp; She suddenly reproached
herself for thoughtlessness; for in her pocket lay a letter from him,
which she had taken from the postman that morning at the moment of coming
from the door, and in the hurry of embarking had forgotten ever since.&nbsp;
Opening it quickly, she read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,&mdash;Your letter reached
me yesterday, and I called round at Exonbury Crescent in the afternoon,
as you wished.&nbsp; Everything is going on right there, and you have
no occasion to be anxious about them.&nbsp; I do not leave town for
another week or two, and by the time I am gone Sol and Dan will have
returned from Paris, if your mother and Gwendoline want any help: so
that you need not hurry back on their account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have something else to tell you, which is not quite so satisfactory,
and it is this that makes me write at once; but do not be alarmed.&nbsp;
It began in this way.&nbsp; A few nights after the dinner-party here
I was determined to find out if there was any truth in what you had
been told about that boy, and having seen Menlove go out as usual after
dark, I followed her.&nbsp; Sure enough, when she had got into the park,
up came master Joe, smoking a cigar.&nbsp; As soon as they had met I
went towards them, and Menlove, seeing somebody draw nigh, began to
edge off, when the blockhead said, &ldquo;Never mind, my love, it is
only the old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being very provoked with both of them,
though she was really the most to blame, I gave him some smart cuts
across the shoulders with my cane, and told him to go home, which he
did with a flea in his ear, the rascal.&nbsp; I believe I have cured
his courting tricks for some little time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Menlove then walked by me, quite cool, as if she were
merely a lady passing by chance at the time, which provoked me still
more, knowing the whole truth of it, and I could not help turning upon
her and saying, &ldquo;You, madam, ought to be served the same way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She replied in very haughty words, and I walked away, saying that I
had something better to do than argue with a woman of her character
at that hour of the evening.&nbsp; This so set her up that she followed
me home, marched into my pantry, and told me that if I had been more
careful about my manners in calling her a bad character, it might have
been better both for me and my stuck-up daughter&mdash;a daw in eagle&rsquo;s
plumes&mdash;and so on.&nbsp; Now it seems that she must have coaxed
something out of Joey about you&mdash;for what lad in the world could
be a match for a woman of her experience and arts!&nbsp; I hope she
will do you no serious damage; but I tell you the whole state of affairs
exactly as they are, that you may form your own opinions.&nbsp; After
all, there is no real disgrace, for none of us have ever done wrong,
but have worked honestly for a living.&nbsp; However, I will let you
know if anything serious really happens.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was all that her father said on the matter, the letter concluding
with messages to the children and directions from their mother with
regard to their clothes.</p>
<p>Ethelberta felt very distinctly that she was in a strait; the old
impression that, unless her position were secured soon, it never would
be secured, returned with great force.&nbsp; A doubt whether it was
worth securing would have been very strong ere this, had not others
besides herself been concerned in her fortunes.&nbsp; She looked up
from her letter, and beheld the pertinacious yacht; it led her up to
a conviction that therein lay a means and an opportunity.</p>
<p>Nothing further of importance occurred in crossing.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s
head ached after a while, and Cornelia&rsquo;s healthy cheeks of red
were found to have diminished their colour to the size of a wafer and
the quality of a stain.&nbsp; The <i>Speedwell</i> entered the breakwater
at Cherbourg to find the schooner already in the roadstead; and by the
time the steamer was brought up Ethelberta could see the men on board
the yacht clewing up and making things snug in a way from which she
inferred that they were not going to leave the harbour again that day.&nbsp;
With the aspect of a fair galleon that could easily out-manoeuvre her
persevering buccaneer, Ethelberta passed alongside.&nbsp; Could it be
possible that Lord Mountclere had on her account fixed this day for
his visit across the Channel?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I would rather be haunted by him than by Mr. Neigh,&rsquo;
she said; and began laying her plans so as to guard against inconvenient
surprises.</p>
<p>The next morning Ethelberta was at the railway station, taking tickets
for herself and Cornelia, when she saw an old yet sly and somewhat merry-faced
Englishman a little way off.&nbsp; He was attended by a younger man,
who appeared to be his valet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will exchange one of these tickets,&rsquo; she said to the
clerk, and having done so she went to Cornelia to inform her that it
would after all be advisable for them to travel separate, adding, &lsquo;Lord
Mountclere is in the station, and I think he is going on by our train.&nbsp;
Remember, you are my maid again now.&nbsp; Is not that the gentlemanly
man who assisted you yesterday?&rsquo;&nbsp; She signified the valet
as she spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Cornelia.</p>
<p>When the passengers were taking their seats, and Ethelberta was thinking
whether she might not after all enter a second-class with Cornelia instead
of sitting solitary in a first because of an old man&rsquo;s proximity,
she heard a shuffling at her elbow, and the next moment found that he
was overtly observing her as if he had not done so in secret at all.&nbsp;
She at once gave him an unsurprised gesture of recognition.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
saw you some time ago; what a singular coincidence,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A charming one,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere, smiling a half-minute
smile, and making as if he would take his hat off and would not quite.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps we must not call it coincidence entirely,&rsquo; he continued;
&lsquo;my journey, which I have contemplated for some time, was not
fixed this week altogether without a thought of your presence on the
road&mdash;hee-hee!&nbsp; Do you go far to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As far as Caen,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the end of my day&rsquo;s journey,
too,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; They parted and took their respective
places, Lord Mountclere choosing a compartment next to the one Ethelberta
was entering, and not, as she had expected, attempting to join her.</p>
<p>Now she had instantly fancied when the viscount was speaking that
there were signs of some departure from his former respectful manner
towards her; and an enigma lay in that.&nbsp; At their earlier meetings
he had never ventured upon a distinct coupling of himself and herself
as he had done in his broad compliment to-day&mdash;if compliment it
could be called.&nbsp; She was not sure that he did not exceed his license
in telling her deliberately that he had meant to hover near her in a
private journey which she was taking without reference to him.&nbsp;
She did not object to the act, but to the avowal of the act; and, being
as sensitive as a barometer on signs affecting her social condition,
it darted upon Ethelberta for one little moment that he might possibly
have heard a word or two about her being nothing more nor less than
one of a tribe of thralls; hence his freedom of manner.&nbsp; Certainly
a plain remark of that sort was exactly what a susceptible peer might
be supposed to say to a pretty woman of far inferior degree.&nbsp; A
rapid redness filled her face at the thought that he might have smiled
upon her as upon a domestic whom he was disposed to chuck under the
chin.&nbsp; &lsquo;But no,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He would never
have taken the trouble to follow and meet with me had he learnt to think
me other than a lady.&nbsp; It is extremity of devotion&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not Ethelberta&rsquo;s inexperience, but that her conception
of self precluded such an association of ideas, which led her to dismiss
the surmise that his attendance could be inspired by a motive beyond
that of paying her legitimate attentions as a co-ordinate with him and
his in the social field.&nbsp; Even if he only meant flirtation, she
read it as of that sort from which courtship with an eye to matrimony
differs only in degree.&nbsp; Hence, she thought, his interest in her
was not likely, under the ordinary influences of caste feeling, to continue
longer than while he was kept in ignorance of her consanguinity with
a stock proscribed.&nbsp; She sighed at the anticipated close of her
full-feathered towering when her ties and bonds should be uncovered.&nbsp;
She might have seen matters in a different light, and sighed more.&nbsp;
But in the stir of the moment it escaped her thought that ignorance
of her position, and a consequent regard for her as a woman of good
standing, would have prevented his indulgence in any course which was
open to the construction of being disrespectful.</p>
<p>Valognes, Carentan, Isigny, Bayeux, were passed, and the train drew
up at Caen.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s intention had been to stay here
for one night, but having learnt from Lord Mountclere, as previously
described, that this was his destination, she decided to go on.&nbsp;
On turning towards the carriage after a few minutes of promenading at
the Caen station, she was surprised to perceive that Lord Mountclere,
who had alighted as if to leave, was still there.</p>
<p>They spoke again to each other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I find I have to go
further,&rsquo; he suddenly said, when she had chatted with him a little
time.&nbsp; And beckoning to the man who was attending to his baggage,
he directed the things to be again placed in the train.</p>
<p>Time passed, and they changed at the next junction.&nbsp; When Ethelberta
entered a carriage on the branch line to take her seat for the remainder
of the journey, there sat the viscount in the same division.&nbsp; He
explained that he was going to Rouen.</p>
<p>Ethelberta came to a quick resolution.&nbsp; Her audacity, like that
of a child getting nearer and nearer a parent&rsquo;s side, became wonderfully
vigorous as she approached her destination; and though there were three
good hours of travel to Rouen as yet, the heavier part of the journey
was past.&nbsp; At her aunt&rsquo;s would be a safe refuge, play what
pranks she might, and there she would to-morrow meet those bravest of
defenders Sol and Dan, to whom she had sent as much money as she could
conveniently spare towards their expenses, with directions that they
were to come by the most economical route, and meet her at the house
of her aunt, Madame Moulin, previous to their educational trip to Paris,
their own contribution being the value of the week&rsquo;s work they
would have to lose.&nbsp; Thus backed up by Sol and Dan, her aunt, and
Cornelia, Ethelberta felt quite the reverse of a lonely female persecuted
by a wicked lord in a foreign country.&nbsp; &lsquo;He shall pay for
his weaknesses, whatever they mean,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and what
they mean I will find out at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to Paris,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot to-night, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to go on to-morrow.&nbsp; Perhaps I may.&nbsp;
So that there is a chance of our meeting again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but I do not leave Rouen till the afternoon.&nbsp; I
first shall go to the cathedral, and drive round the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere smiled pleasantly.&nbsp; There seemed a sort of encouragement
in her words.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s thoughts, however, had flown
at that moment to the approaching situation at her aunt&rsquo;s hotel:
it would be extremely embarrassing if he should go there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where do you stay, Lord Mountclere?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Thus directly asked, he could not but commit himself to the name
of the hotel he had been accustomed to patronize, which was one in the
upper part of the city.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine is not that one,&rsquo; said Ethelberta frigidly.</p>
<p>No further remark was made under this head, and they conversed for
the remainder of the daylight on scenery and other topics, Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
air of festivity lending him all the qualities of an agreeable companion.&nbsp;
But notwithstanding her resolve, Ethelberta failed, for that day at
least, to make her mind clear upon Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s intentions.&nbsp;
To that end she would have liked first to know what were the exact limits
set by society to conduct under present conditions, if society had ever
set any at all, which was open to question: since experience had long
ago taught her that much more freedom actually prevails in the communion
of the sexes than is put on paper as etiquette, or admitted in so many
words as correct behaviour.&nbsp; In short, everything turned upon whether
he had learnt of her position when off the platform at Mayfair Hall.</p>
<p>Wearied with these surmises, and the day&rsquo;s travel, she closed
her eyes.&nbsp; And then her enamoured companion more widely opened
his, and traced the beautiful features opposite him.&nbsp; The arch
of the brows&mdash;like a slur in music&mdash;the droop of the lashes,
the meeting of the lips, and the sweet rotundity of the chin&mdash;one
by one, and all together, they were adored, till his heart was like
a retort full of spirits of wine.</p>
<p>It was a warm evening, and when they arrived at their journey&rsquo;s
end distant thunder rolled behind heavy and opaque clouds.&nbsp; Ethelberta
bade adieu to her attentive satellite, called to Cornelia, and entered
a cab; but before they reached the inn the thunder had increased.&nbsp;
Then a cloud cracked into flame behind the iron spire of the cathedral,
showing in relief its black ribs and stanchions, as if they were the
bars of a blazing cresset held on high.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, we will clamber up there to-morrow,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>A wondrous stillness pervaded the streets of the city after this,
though it was not late; and their arrival at M. Moulin&rsquo;s door
was quite an event for the quay.&nbsp; No rain came, as they had expected,
and by the time they halted the western sky had cleared, so that the
newly-lit lamps on the quay, and the evening glow shining over the river,
inwove their harmonious rays as the warp and woof of one lustrous tissue.&nbsp;
Before they had alighted there appeared from the archway Madame Moulin
in person, followed by the servants of the hotel in a manner signifying
that they did not receive a visitor once a fortnight, though at that
moment the clatter of sixty knives, forks, and tongues was audible through
an open window from the adjoining dining-room, to the great interest
of a group of idlers outside.&nbsp; Ethelberta had not seen her aunt
since she last passed through the town with Lady Petherwin, who then
told her that this landlady was the only respectable relative she seemed
to have in the world.</p>
<p>Aunt Charlotte&rsquo;s face was an English outline filled in with
French shades under the eyes, on the brows, and round the mouth, by
the natural effect of years; she resembled the British hostess as little
as well could be, no point in her causing the slightest suggestion of
drops taken for the stomach&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Telling the two young
women she would gladly have met them at the station had she known the
hour of their arrival, she kissed them both without much apparent notice
of a difference in their conditions; indeed, seeming rather to incline
to Cornelia, whose country face and homely style of clothing may have
been more to her mind than Ethelberta&rsquo;s finished travelling-dress,
a class of article to which she appeared to be well accustomed.&nbsp;
Her husband was at this time at the head of the table-d&rsquo;hote,
and mentioning the fact as an excuse for his non-appearance, she accompanied
them upstairs.</p>
<p>After the strain of keeping up smiles with Lord Mountclere, the rattle
and shaking, and the general excitements of the chase across the water
and along the rail, a face in which she saw a dim reflex of her mother&rsquo;s
was soothing in the extreme, and Ethelberta went up to the staircase
with a feeling of expansive thankfulness.&nbsp; Cornelia paused to admire
the clean court and the small caged birds sleeping on their perches,
the boxes of veronica in bloom, of oleander, and of tamarisk, which
freshened the air of the court and lent a romance to the lamplight,
the cooks in their paper caps and white blouses appearing at odd moments
from an Avernus behind; while the prompt &lsquo;v&rsquo;la!&rsquo; of
teetotums in mob caps, spinning down the staircase in answer to the
periodic clang of bells, filled her with wonder, and pricked her conscience
with thoughts of how seldom such transcendent nimbleness was attempted
by herself in a part so nearly similar.</p>
<h2>34. THE H&Ocirc;TEL BEAU S&Eacute;JOUR AND SPOTS NEAR IT</h2>
<p>The next day, much to Ethelberta&rsquo;s surprise, there was a letter
for her in her mother&rsquo;s up-hill hand.&nbsp; She neglected all
the rest of its contents for the following engrossing sentences:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Menlove has wormed everything out of poor Joey,
we find, and your father is much upset about it.&nbsp; She had another
quarrel with him, and then declared she would expose you and us to Mrs.
Doncastle and all your friends.&nbsp; I think that Menlove is the kind
of woman who will stick to her word, and the question for you to consider
is, how can you best face out any report of the truth which she will
spread, and contradict the lies that she will add to it?&nbsp; It appears
to me to be a dreadful thing, and so it will probably appear to you.&nbsp;
The worst part will be that your sisters and brothers are your servants,
and that your father is actually engaged in the house where you dine.&nbsp;
I am dreadful afraid that this will be considered a fine joke for gossips,
and will cause no end of laughs in society at your expense.&nbsp; At
any rate, should Menlove spread the report, it would absolutely prevent
people from attending your lectures next season, for they would feel
like dupes, and be angry with theirselves, and you, and all of us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only way out of the muddle that I can see for you is to
put some scheme of marrying into effect as soon as possible, and before
these things are known.&nbsp; Surely by this time, with all your opportunities,
you have been able to strike up an acquaintance with some gentleman
or other, so as to make a suitable match.&nbsp; You see, my dear Berta,
marriage is a thing which, once carried out, fixes you more firm in
a position than any personal brains can do; for as you stand at present,
every loose tooth, and every combed-out hair, and every new wrinkle,
and every sleepless night, is so much took away from your chance for
the future, depending as it do upon your skill in charming.&nbsp; I
know that you have had some good offers, so do listen to me, and warm
up the best man of them again a bit, and get him to repeat his words
before your roundness shrinks away, and &rsquo;tis too late.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ladywell has called here to see you; it was just after
I had heard that this Menlove might do harm, so I thought I could do
no better than send down word to him that you would much like to see
him, and were wondering sadly why he had not called lately.&nbsp; I
gave him your address at Rouen, that he might find you, if he chose,
at once, and be got to propose, since he is better than nobody.&nbsp;
I believe he said, directly Joey gave him the address, that he was going
abroad, and my opinion is that he will come to you, because of the encouragement
I gave him.&nbsp; If so, you must thank me for my foresight and care
for you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heave a sigh of relief sometimes at the thought that I,
at any rate, found a husband before the present man-famine began.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t refuse him this time, there&rsquo;s a dear, or, mark my
words, you&rsquo;ll have cause to rue it&mdash;unless you have beforehand
got engaged to somebody better than he.&nbsp; You will not if you have
not already, for the exposure is sure to come soon.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;O, this false position!&mdash;it is ruining your nature, my
too thoughtful mother!&nbsp; But I will not accept any of them&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
brazen it out!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, throwing the letter wherever
it chose to fly, and picking it up to read again.&nbsp; She stood and
thought it all over.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must decide to do something!&rsquo;
was her sigh again; and, feeling an irresistible need of motion, she
put on her things and went out to see what resolve the morning would
bring.</p>
<p>No rain had fallen during the night, and the air was now quiet in
a warm heavy fog, through which old cider-smells, reminding her of Wessex,
occasionally came from narrow streets in the background.&nbsp; Ethelberta
passed up the Rue Grand-Pont into the little dusky Rue Saint-Romain,
behind the cathedral, being driven mechanically along by the fever and
fret of her thoughts.&nbsp; She was about to enter the building by the
transept door, when she saw Lord Mountclere coming towards her.</p>
<p>Ethelberta felt equal to him, or a dozen such, this morning.&nbsp;
The looming spectres raised by her mother&rsquo;s information, the wearing
sense of being over-weighted in the race, were driving her to a Hamlet-like
fantasticism and defiance of augury; moreover, she was abroad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am about to ascend to the parapets of the cathedral,&rsquo;
said she, in answer to a half inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be delighted to accompany you,&rsquo; he rejoined,
in a manner as capable of explanation by his knowledge of her secret
as was Ethelberta&rsquo;s manner by her sense of nearing the end of
her maying.&nbsp; But whether this frequent glide into her company was
meant as ephemeral flirtation, to fill the half-hours of his journey,
or whether it meant a serious love-suit&mdash;which were the only alternatives
that had occurred to her on the subject&mdash;did not trouble her now.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am bound to be civil to so great a lord,&rsquo; she lightly
thought, and expressing no objection to his presence, she passed with
him through the outbuildings, containing Gothic lumber from the shadowy
pile above, and ascended the stone staircase.&nbsp; Emerging from its
windings, they duly came to the long wooden ladder suspended in mid-air
that led to the parapet of the tower.&nbsp; This being wide enough for
two abreast, she could hardly do otherwise than wait a moment for the
viscount, who up to this point had never faltered, and who amused her
as they went by scraps of his experience in various countries, which,
to do him justice, he told with vivacity and humour.&nbsp; Thus they
reached the end of the flight, and entered behind a balustrade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The prospect will be very lovely from this point when the
fog has blown off,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere faintly, for climbing
and chattering at the same time had fairly taken away his breath.&nbsp;
He leant against the masonry to rest himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;The air is
clearing already; I fancy I saw a sunbeam or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be lovelier above,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
us go to the platform at the base of the <i>fl&egrave;che</i>, and wait
for a view there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said her attentive companion.</p>
<p>They passed in at a door and up some more stone steps, which landed
them finally in the upper chamber of the tower.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere
sank on a beam, and asked smilingly if her ambition was not satisfied
with this goal.&nbsp; &lsquo;I recollect going to the top some years
ago,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and it did not occur to me as being a thing
worth doing a second time.&nbsp; And there was no fog then, either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, &lsquo;it is one of the most splendid
things a person can do!&nbsp; The fog is going fast, and everybody with
the least artistic feeling in the direction of bird&rsquo;s-eye views
makes the ascent every time of coming here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, of course,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
I am only too happy to go to any height with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since you so kindly offer, we will go to the very top of the
spire&mdash;up through the fog and into the sunshine,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere covered a grim misgiving by a gay smile, and away
they went up a ladder admitting to the base of the huge iron framework
above; then they entered upon the regular ascent of the cage, towards
the hoped-for celestial blue, and among breezes which never descended
so low as the town.&nbsp; The journey was enlivened with more breathless
witticisms from Lord Mountclere, till she stepped ahead of him again;
when he asked how many more steps there were.</p>
<p>She inquired of the man in the blue blouse who accompanied them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fifty-five,&rsquo; she returned to Lord Mountclere a moment later.</p>
<p>They went round, and round, and yet around.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many are there now?&rsquo; Lord Mountclere demanded this
time of the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hundred and ninety, Monsieur,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there were only fifty-five ever so long ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two hundred and five, then,&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps
the mist prevented Mademoiselle hearing me distinctly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind: I would follow were there five thousand more,
did Mademoiselle bid me!&rsquo; said the exhausted nobleman gallantly,
in English.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, with displeasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand a word,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>They paced the remainder of their spiral pathway in silence, and
having at last reached the summit, Lord Mountclere sank down on one
of the steps, panting out, &lsquo;Dear me, dear me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta leaned and looked around, and said, &lsquo;How extraordinary
this is.&nbsp; It is sky above, below, everywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He dragged himself together and stepped to her side.&nbsp; They formed
as it were a little world to themselves, being completely ensphered
by the fog, which here was dense as a sea of milk.&nbsp; Below was neither
town, country, nor cathedral&mdash;simply whiteness, into which the
iron legs of their gigantic perch faded to nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have lost our labour; there is no prospect for you, after
all, Lord Mountclere,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, turning her eyes upon
him.&nbsp; He looked at her face as if there were, and she continued,
&lsquo;Listen; I hear sounds from the town: people&rsquo;s voices, and
carts, and dogs, and the noise of a railway-train.&nbsp; Shall we now
descend, and own ourselves disappointed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whenever you choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before they had put their intention in practice there appeared to
be reasons for waiting awhile.&nbsp; Out of the plain of fog beneath,
a stone tooth seemed to be upheaving itself: then another showed forth.&nbsp;
These were the summits of the St. Romain and the Butter Towers&mdash;at
the western end of the building.&nbsp; As the fog stratum collapsed
other summits manifested their presence further off&mdash;among them
the two spires and lantern of St. Ouen&rsquo;s; when to the left the
dome of St. Madeline&rsquo;s caught a first ray from the peering sun,
under which its scaly surface glittered like a fish.&nbsp; Then the
mist rolled off in earnest, and revealed far beneath them a whole city,
its red, blue, and grey roofs forming a variegated pattern, small and
subdued as that of a pavement in mosaic.&nbsp; Eastward in the spacious
outlook lay the hill of St. Catherine, breaking intrusively into the
large level valley of the Seine; south was the river which had been
the parent of the mist, and the Ile Lacroix, gorgeous in scarlet, purple,
and green.&nbsp; On the western horizon could be dimly discerned melancholy
forests, and further to the right stood the hill and rich groves of
Boisguillaume.</p>
<p>Ethelberta having now done looking around, the descent was begun
and continued without intermission till they came to the passage behind
the parapet.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was about to step airily forward, when there reached her
ear the voices of persons below.&nbsp; She recognized as one of them
the slow unaccented tones of Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please wait a minute!&rsquo; she said in a peremptory manner
of confusion sufficient to attract Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>A recollection had sprung to her mind in a moment.&nbsp; She had
half made an appointment with Neigh at her aunt&rsquo;s hotel for this
very week, and here was he in Rouen to keep it.&nbsp; To meet him while
indulging in this vagary with Lord Mountclere&mdash;which, now that
the mood it had been engendered by was passing off, she somewhat regretted&mdash;would
be the height of imprudence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to go round to the other side of the parapet
for a few moments,&rsquo; she said, with decisive quickness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
with me, Lord Mountclere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went round to the other side.&nbsp; Here she kept the viscount
and their <i>suisse</i> until she deemed it probable that Neigh had
passed by, when she returned with her companions and descended to the
bottom.&nbsp; They emerged into the Rue Saint-Romain, whereupon a woman
called from the opposite side of the way to their guide, stating that
she had told the other English gentleman that the English lady had gone
into the <i>fl&egrave;che</i>.</p>
<p>Ethelberta turned and looked up.&nbsp; She could just discern Neigh&rsquo;s
form upon the steps of the <i>fl&egrave;che</i> above, ascending toilsomely
in search of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What English gentleman could that have been?&rsquo; said Lord
Mountclere, after paying the man.&nbsp; He spoke in a way which showed
he had not overlooked her confusion.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems that he must
have been searching for us, or rather for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Mr. Neigh,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;He told
me he was coming here.&nbsp; I believe he is waiting for an interview
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Business&mdash;only business,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I leave you?&nbsp; Perhaps the business is important&mdash;most
important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unfortunately it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must forgive me this once: I cannot help&mdash;will you
give me permission to make a difficult remark?&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere,
in an impatient voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, the business I meant was&mdash;an engagement to
be married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had it been possible for a woman to be perpetually on the alert she
might now have supposed that Lord Mountclere knew all about her; a mechanical
deference must have restrained such an illusion had he seen her in any
other light than that of a distracting slave.&nbsp; But she answered
quietly, &lsquo;So did I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how does he know&mdash;dear me, dear me!&nbsp; I beg pardon,&rsquo;
said the viscount.</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously, as if to imply that he was seriously
out of his reckoning in respect of her if he supposed that he would
be allowed to continue this little play at love-making as long as he
chose, when she was offered the position of wife by a man so good as
Neigh.</p>
<p>They stood in silence side by side till, much to her ease, Cornelia
appeared at the corner waiting.&nbsp; At the last moment he said, in
somewhat agitated tones, and with what appeared to be a renewal of the
respect which had been imperceptibly dropped since they crossed the
Channel, &lsquo;I was not aware of your engagement to Mr. Neigh.&nbsp;
I fear I have been acting mistakenly on that account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no engagement as yet,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere brightened like a child.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then may I
have a few words in private&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now&mdash;not to-day,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, with a certain
irritation at she knew not what.&nbsp; &lsquo;Believe me, Lord Mountclere,
you are mistaken in many things.&nbsp; I mean, you think more of me
than you ought.&nbsp; A time will come when you will despise me for
this day&rsquo;s work, and it is madness in you to go further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere, knowing what he did know, may have imagined what
she referred to; but Ethelberta was without the least proof that he
had the key to her humour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well, I&rsquo;ll be responsible
for the madness,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you to be&mdash;a
famous woman, at all events; and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; I would
say more, but I cannot here.&nbsp; May I call upon you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When shall I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you must, let it be a month hence at my house in town,&rsquo;
she said indifferently, the Hamlet mood being still upon her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, call upon us then, and I will tell you everything that may
remain to be told, if you should be inclined to listen.&nbsp; A rumour
is afloat which will undeceive you in much, and depress me to death.&nbsp;
And now I will walk back: pray excuse me.&rsquo;&nbsp; She entered the
street, and joined Cornelia.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere paced irregularly along, turned the corner, and went
towards his inn, nearing which his tread grew lighter, till he scarcely
seemed to touch the ground.&nbsp; He became gleeful, and said to himself,
nervously palming his hip with his left hand, as if previous to plunging
it into hot water for some prize: &lsquo;Upon my life I&rsquo;ve a good
mind!&nbsp; Upon my life I have!. . . .&nbsp; I must make a straightforward
thing of it, and at once; or he will have her.&nbsp; But he shall not,
and I will&mdash;hee-hee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fascinated man, screaming inwardly with the excitement, glee,
and agony of his position, entered the hotel, wrote a hasty note to
Ethelberta and despatched it by hand, looked to his dress and appearance,
ordered a carriage, and in a quarter of an hour was being driven towards
the H&ocirc;tel Beau S&eacute;jour, whither his note had preceded him.</p>
<h2>35. THE HOTEL (continued), AND THE QUAY IN FRONT</h2>
<p>Ethelberta, having arrived there some time earlier, had gone straight
to her aunt, whom she found sitting behind a large ledger in the office,
making up the accounts with her husband, a well-framed reflective man
with a grey beard.&nbsp; M. Moulin bustled, waited for her remarks and
replies, and made much of her in a general way, when Ethelberta said,
what she had wanted to say instantly, &lsquo;Has a gentleman called
Mr. Neigh been here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;I think it is Neigh&mdash;there&rsquo;s a card
upstairs,&rsquo; replied her aunt.&nbsp; &lsquo;I told him you were
alone at the cathedral, and I believe he walked that way.&nbsp; Besides
that one, another has come for you&mdash;a Mr. Ladywell, and he is waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; I thought he seemed so anxious, under a
sort of assumed calmness, that I recommended him to remain till you
came in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goodness, aunt; why did you?&rsquo; Ethelberta said, and thought
how much her mother&rsquo;s sister resembled her mother in doings of
that sort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought he had some good reason for seeing you.&nbsp; Are
these men intruders, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;a woman who attempts a public career must expect
to be treated as public property: what would be an intrusion on a domiciled
gentlewoman is a tribute to me.&nbsp; You cannot have celebrity and
sex-privilege both.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus Ethelberta laughed off the awkward
conjuncture, inwardly deploring the unconscionable maternal meddling
which had led to this, though not resentfully, for she had too much
staunchness of heart to decry a parent&rsquo;s misdirected zeal.&nbsp;
Had the clanship feeling been universally as strong as in the Chickerel
family, the fable of the well-bonded fagot might have remained unwritten.</p>
<p>Ladywell had sent her a letter about getting his picture of herself
engraved for an illustrated paper, and she had not replied, considering
that she had nothing to do with the matter, her form and feature having
been given in the painting as no portrait at all, but as those of an
ideal.&nbsp; To see him now would be vexatious; and yet it was chilly
and formal to an ungenerous degree to keep aloof from him, sitting lonely
in the same house.&nbsp; &lsquo;A few weeks hence,&rsquo; she thought,
&lsquo;when Menlove&rsquo;s disclosures make me ridiculous, he may slight
me as a lackey&rsquo;s girl, an upstart, an adventuress, and hardly
return my bow in the street.&nbsp; Then I may wish I had given him no
personal cause for additional bitterness.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, putting off
the fine lady, Ethelberta thought she would see Ladywell at once.</p>
<p>Ladywell was unaffectedly glad to meet her; so glad, that Ethelberta
wished heartily, for his sake, there could be warm friendship between
herself and him, as well as all her lovers, without that insistent courtship-and-marriage
question, which sent them all scattering like leaves in a pestilent
blast, at enmity with one another.&nbsp; She was less pleased when she
found that Ladywell, after saying all there was to say about his painting,
gently signified that he had been misinformed, as he believed, concerning
her future intentions, which had led to his absenting himself entirely
from her; the remark being of course, a natural product of her mother&rsquo;s
injudicious message to him.</p>
<p>She cut him short with terse candour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;a false report is in circulation.&nbsp; I am not yet engaged
to be married to any one, if that is your meaning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ladywell looked cheerful at this frank answer, and said tentatively,
&lsquo;Am I forgotten?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; you are exactly as you always were in my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I have been cruelly deceived.&nbsp; I was guided too
much by appearances, and they were very delusive.&nbsp; I am beyond
measure glad I came here to-day.&nbsp; I called at your house and learnt
that you were here; and as I was going out of town, in any indefinite
direction, I settled then to come this way.&nbsp; What a happy idea
it was!&nbsp; To think of you now&mdash;and I may be permitted to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assuredly you may not.&nbsp; How many times I have told you
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do not wish for any formal engagement,&rsquo; said Ladywell
quickly, fearing she might commit herself to some expression of positive
denial, which he could never surmount.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
wait any length of time.&nbsp; Remember, you have never absolutely forbidden
my&mdash;friendship.&nbsp; Will you delay your answer till some time
hence, when you have thoroughly considered; since I fear it may be a
hasty one now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed; it may be hasty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will delay it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When shall it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say a month hence.&nbsp; I suggest that, because by that time
you will have found an answer in your own mind: strange things may happen
before then.&nbsp; &ldquo;She shall follow after her lovers, but she
shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
them; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first&rdquo;&mdash;however,
that&rsquo;s no matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;did you&mdash;?&rsquo; Ladywell began, altogether
bewildered by this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a passage in Hosea which came to my mind, as possibly
applicable to myself some day,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was mere impulse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha!&mdash;a jest&mdash;one of your romances broken loose.&nbsp;
There is no law for impulse: that is why I am here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus fancifully they conversed till the interview concluded.&nbsp;
Getting her to promise that she would see him again, Ladywell retired
to a sitting-room on the same landing, in which he had been writing
letters before she came up.&nbsp; Immediately upon this her aunt, who
began to suspect that something peculiar was in the wind, came to tell
her that Mr. Neigh had been inquiring for her again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send him in,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>Neigh&rsquo;s footsteps approached, and the well-known figure entered.&nbsp;
Ethelberta received him smilingly, for she was getting so used to awkward
juxtapositions that she treated them quite as a natural situation.&nbsp;
She merely hoped that Ladywell would not hear them talking through the
partition.</p>
<p>Neigh scarcely said anything as a beginning: she knew his errand
perfectly; and unaccountable as it was to her, the strange and unceremonious
relationship between them, that had originated in the peculiar conditions
of their first close meeting, was continued now as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been able to bestow a thought on the question between
us?&nbsp; I hope so,&rsquo; said Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no use,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait a
month, and you will not require an answer.&nbsp; You will not mind speaking
low, because of a person in the next room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&mdash;Why will that be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might say; but let us speak of something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can,&rsquo; said Neigh brusquely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had no other reason on earth for calling here.&nbsp; I wished
to get the matter settled, and I could not be satisfied without seeing
you.&nbsp; I hate writing on matters of this sort.&nbsp; In fact I can&rsquo;t
do it, and that&rsquo;s why I am here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was still speaking when an attendant entered with a note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you excuse me one moment?&rsquo; said Ethelberta, stepping
to the window and opening the missive.&nbsp; It contained these words
only, in a scrawl so full of deformities that she could hardly piece
its meaning together:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I must see you again to-day unless you absolutely
deny yourself to me, which I shall take as a refusal to meet me any
more.&nbsp; I will arrive, punctually, five minutes after you receive
this note.&nbsp; Do pray be alone if you can, and eternally gratify,&mdash;Yours,</p>
<p>&lsquo;MOUNTCLERE.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;If anything has happened I shall be pleased to wait,&rsquo;
said Neigh, seeing her concern when she had closed the note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, it is nothing,&rsquo; said Ethelberta precipitately.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet I think I will ask you to wait,&rsquo; she added, not liking
to dismiss Neigh in a hurry; for she was not insensible to his perseverance
in seeking her over all these miles of sea and land; and secondly, she
feared that if he were to leave on the instant he might run into the
arms of Lord Mountclere and Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be only too happy to stay till you are at leisure,&rsquo;
said Neigh, in the unimpassioned delivery he used whether his meaning
were a trite compliment or the expression of his most earnest feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may be rather a long time,&rsquo; said Ethelberta dubiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My time is yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta left the room and hurried to her aunt, exclaiming, &lsquo;O,
Aunt Charlotte, I hope you have rooms enough to spare for my visitors,
for they are like the fox, the goose, and the corn, in the riddle; I
cannot leave them together, and I can only be with one at a time.&nbsp;
I want the nicest drawing-room you have for an interview of a bare two
minutes with an old gentleman.&nbsp; I am so sorry this has happened,
but it is not altogether my fault!&nbsp; I only arranged to see one
of them; but the other was sent to me by mother, in a mistake, and the
third met with me on my journey: that&rsquo;s the explanation.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the oldest of them just come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked through the glass partition, and under the arch of the
court-gate, as the wheels of the viscount&rsquo;s carriage were heard
outside.&nbsp; Ethelberta ascended to a room on the first floor, Lord
Mountclere was shown up, and the door closed upon them.</p>
<p>At this time Neigh was very comfortably lounging in an arm-chair
in Ethelberta&rsquo;s room on the second floor.&nbsp; This was a pleasant
enough way of passing the minutes with such a tender interview in prospect;
and as he leant he looked with languid and luxurious interest through
the open casement at the spars and rigging of some luggers on the Seine,
the pillars of the suspension bridge, and the scenery of the Faubourg
St. Sever on the other side of the river.&nbsp; How languid his interest
might ultimately have become there is no knowing; but there soon arose
upon his ear the accents of Ethelberta in low distinctness from somewhere
outside the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; the scene is pleasant to-day,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I like a view over a river.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think the steamboats are objectionable when they
stop here,&rsquo; said another person.</p>
<p>Neigh&rsquo;s face closed in to an aspect of perplexity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely
that cannot be Lord Mountclere?&rsquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Had he been certain that Ethelberta was only talking to a stranger,
Neigh would probably have felt their conversation to be no business
of his, much as he might have been surprised to find her giving audience
to another man at such a place.&nbsp; But his impression that the voice
was that of his acquaintance, Lord Mountclere, coupled with doubts as
to its possibility, was enough to lead him to rise from the chair and
put his head out of the window.</p>
<p>Upon a balcony beneath him were the speakers, as he had suspected&mdash;Ethelberta
and the viscount.</p>
<p>Looking right and left, he saw projecting from the next window the
head of his friend Ladywell, gazing right and left likewise, apparently
just drawn out by the same voice which had attracted himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;you, Neigh!&mdash;how strange,&rsquo; came from
Ladywell&rsquo;s lips before he had time to recollect that great coolness
existed between himself and Neigh on Ethelberta&rsquo;s account, which
had led to the reduction of their intimacy to the most attenuated of
nods and good-mornings ever since the Harlequin-rose incident at Cripplegate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it is rather strange,&rsquo; said Neigh, with saturnine
evenness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still a fellow must be somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each then looked over his window-sill downwards, upon the speakers
who had attracted them thither.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere uttered something in a low tone which did not reach
the young men; to which Ethelberta replied, &lsquo;As I have said, Lord
Mountclere, I cannot give you an answer now.&nbsp; I must consider what
to do with Mr. Neigh and Mr. Ladywell.&nbsp; It is too sudden for me
to decide at once.&nbsp; I could not do so until I have got home to
England, when I will write you a letter, stating frankly my affairs
and those of my relatives.&nbsp; I shall not consider that you have
addressed me on the subject of marriage until, having received my letter,
you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Repeat my proposal,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Mrs. Petherwin, it is as good as repeated!&nbsp; But
I have no right to assume anything you don&rsquo;t wish me to assume,
and I will wait.&nbsp; How long is it that I am to suffer in this uncertainty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A month.&nbsp; By that time I shall have grown weary of my
other two suitors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A month!&nbsp; Really inflexible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta had returned inside the window, and her answer was inaudible.&nbsp;
Ladywell and Neigh looked up, and their eyes met.&nbsp; Both had been
reluctant to remain where they stood, but they were too fascinated to
instantly retire.&nbsp; Neigh moved now, and Ladywell did the same.&nbsp;
Each saw that the face of his companion was flushed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in and see me,&rsquo; said Ladywell quickly, before quite
withdrawing his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am staying in this room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Neigh; and taking his hat he left Ethelberta&rsquo;s
apartment forthwith.</p>
<p>On entering the quarters of his friend he found him seated at a table
whereon writing materials were strewn.&nbsp; They shook hands in silence,
but the meaning in their looks was enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just let me write a note, Ladywell, and I&rsquo;m your man,&rsquo;
said Neigh then, with the freedom of an old acquaintance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was going to do the same thing,&rsquo; said Ladywell.</p>
<p>Neigh then sat down, and for a minute or two nothing was to be heard
but the scratching of a pair of pens, ending on the one side with a
more boisterous scratch, as the writer shaped &lsquo;Eustace Ladywell,&rsquo;
and on the other with slow firmness in the characters &lsquo;Alfred
Neigh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s for you, my fair one,&rsquo; said Neigh, closing
and directing his letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours is for Mrs. Petherwin?&nbsp; So is mine,&rsquo; said
Ladywell, grasping the bell-pull.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I direct it to
be put on her table with this one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the two letters went off to Ethelberta&rsquo;s
sitting-room, which she had vacated to receive Lord Mountclere in an
empty one beneath.&nbsp; Neigh&rsquo;s letter was simply a pleading
of a sudden call away which prevented his waiting till she should return;
Ladywell&rsquo;s, though stating the same reason for leaving, was more
of an upbraiding nature, and might almost have told its reader, were
she to take the trouble to guess, that he knew of the business of Lord
Mountclere with her to-day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, let us get out of this place,&rsquo; said Neigh.&nbsp;
He proceeded at once down the stairs, followed by Ladywell, who&mdash;settling
his account at the bureau without calling for a bill, and directing
his portmanteau to be sent to the Right-bank railway station&mdash;went
with Neigh into the street.</p>
<p>They had not walked fifty yards up the quay when two British workmen,
in holiday costume, who had just turned the corner of the Rue Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc, approached them.&nbsp; Seeing him to be an Englishman,
one of the two addressed Neigh, saying, &lsquo;Can you tell us the way,
sir, to the Hotel Bold Soldier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh pointed out the place he had just come from to the tall young
men, and continued his walk with Ladywell.</p>
<p>Ladywell was the first to break silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been
considerably misled, Neigh,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I imagine from
what has just happened that you have been misled too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just a little,&rsquo; said Neigh, bringing abstracted lines
of meditation into his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it was my own fault: for
I ought to have known that these stage and platform women have what
they are pleased to call Bohemianism so thoroughly engrained with their
natures that they are no more constant to usage in their sentiments
than they are in their way of living.&nbsp; Good Lord, to think she
has caught old Mountclere!&nbsp; She is sure to have him if she does
not dally with him so long that he gets cool again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A beautiful creature like her to think of marrying such an
infatuated idiot as he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He can give her a title as well as younger men.&nbsp; It will
not be the first time that such matches have been made.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Ladywell vehemently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She has too much poetry in her&mdash;too much good sense; her
nature is the essence of all that&rsquo;s romantic.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help saying it, though she has treated me cruelly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has good looks, certainly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll own to that.&nbsp;
As for her romance and good-feeling, that I leave to you.&nbsp; I think
she has treated you no more cruelly, as you call it, than she has me,
come to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told me she would give me an answer in a month,&rsquo;
said Ladywell emotionally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So she told me,&rsquo; said Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so she told him,&rsquo; said Ladywell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I have no doubt she will keep her word to him in her usual
precise manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But see what she implied to me!&nbsp; I distinctly understood
from her that the answer would be favourable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So did I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So does he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he is sure to be the one who gets it, since only one of
us can.&nbsp; Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t marry her for love, money, nor&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offspring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly: I would not.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an
answer in a month&rdquo;&mdash;to all three of us!&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake let&rsquo;s sit down here and have something to drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They drew up a couple of chairs to one of the tables of a wine-shop
close by, and shouted to the waiter with the vigour of persons going
to the dogs.&nbsp; Here, behind the horizontal-headed trees that dotted
this part of the quay, they sat over their bottles denouncing womankind
till the sun got low down upon the river, and the houses on the further
side began to be toned by a blue mist.&nbsp; At last they rose from
their seats and departed, Neigh to dine and consider his route, and
Ladywell to take the train for Dieppe.</p>
<p>While these incidents had been in progress the two workmen had found
their way into the hotel where Ethelberta was staying.&nbsp; Passing
through the entrance, they stood at gaze in the court, much perplexed
as to the door to be made for; the difficulty was solved by the appearance
of Cornelia, who in expectation of them had been for the last half-hour
leaning over the sill of her bed-room window, which looked into the
interior, amusing herself by watching the movements to and fro in the
court beneath.</p>
<p>After conversing awhile in undertones as if they had no real right
there at all, Cornelia told them she would call their sister, if an
old gentleman who had been to see her were gone again.&nbsp; Cornelia
then ran away, and Sol and Dan stood aloof, till they had seen the old
gentleman alluded to go to the door and drive off, shortly after which
Ethelberta ran down to meet them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever have you got as your luggage?&rsquo; she said, after
hearing a few words about their journey, and looking at a curious object
like a huge extended accordion with bellows of gorgeous-patterned carpeting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I thought to myself,&rsquo; said Sol, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis
a terrible bother about carrying our things.&nbsp; So what did I do
but turn to and make a carpet-bag that would hold all mine and Dan&rsquo;s
too.&nbsp; This, you see, Berta, is a deal top and bottom out of three-quarter
stuff, stained and varnished.&nbsp; Well, then you see I&rsquo;ve got
carpet sides tacked on with these brass nails, which make it look very
handsome; and so when my bag is empty &rsquo;twill shut up and be only
a couple of boards under yer arm, and when &rsquo;tis open it will hold
a&rsquo;most anything you like to put in it.&nbsp; That portmantle didn&rsquo;t
cost more than three half-crowns altogether, and ten pound wouldn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; got anything so strong from a portmantle maker, would it,
Dan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then you see, Berta,&rsquo; Sol continued in the same
earnest tone, and further exhibiting the article, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
made this trap-door in the top with hinges and padlock complete, so
that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid it is tiring you after your journey to explain
all this to me,&rsquo; said Ethelberta gently, noticing that a few Gallic
smilers were gathering round.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aunt has found a nice room
for you at the top of the staircase in that corner&mdash;&ldquo;Escalier
D&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll see painted at the bottom&mdash;and when you have
been up come across to me at number thirty-four on this side, and we&rsquo;ll
talk about everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, Sol,&rsquo; said Dan, who had left his brother
and gone on to the stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a rum staircase&mdash;the
treads all in little blocks, and painted chocolate, as I am alive!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I shall not be able to go on to Paris with you,
after all,&rsquo; Ethelberta continued to Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something
has just happened which makes it desirable for me to return at once
to England.&nbsp; But I will write a list of all you are to see, and
where you are to go, so that it will make little difference, I hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes before this time Ethelberta had been frankly and earnestly
asked by Lord Mountclere to become his bride; not only so, but he pressed
her to consent to have the ceremony performed before they returned to
England.&nbsp; Ethelberta had unquestionably been much surprised; and,
barring the fact that the viscount was somewhat ancient in comparison
with herself, the temptation to close with his offer was strong, and
would have been felt as such by any woman in the position of Ethelberta,
now a little reckless by stress of circumstances, and tinged with a
bitterness of spirit against herself and the world generally.&nbsp;
But she was experienced enough to know what heaviness might result from
a hasty marriage, entered into with a mind full of concealments and
suppressions which, if told, were likely to stop the marriage altogether;
and after trying to bring herself to speak of her family and situation
to Lord Mountclere as he stood, a certain caution triumphed, and she
concluded that it would be better to postpone her reply till she could
consider which of two courses it would be advisable to adopt; to write
and explain to him, or to explain nothing and refuse him.&nbsp; The
third course, to explain nothing and hasten the wedding, she rejected
without hesitation.&nbsp; With a pervading sense of her own obligations
in forming this compact it did not occur to her to ask if Lord Mountclere
might not have duties of explanation equally with herself, though bearing
rather on the moral than the social aspects of the case.</p>
<p>Her resolution not to go on to Paris was formed simply because Lord
Mountclere himself was proceeding in that direction, which might lead
to other unseemly rencounters with him had she, too, persevered in her
journey.&nbsp; She accordingly gave Sol and Dan directions for their
guidance to Paris and back, starting herself with Cornelia the next
day to return again to Knollsea, and to decide finally and for ever
what to do in the vexed question at present agitating her.</p>
<p>Never before in her life had she treated marriage in such a terribly
cool and cynical spirit as she had done that day; she was almost frightened
at herself in thinking of it.&nbsp; How far any known system of ethics
might excuse her on the score of those curious pressures which had been
brought to bear upon her life, or whether it could excuse her at all,
she had no spirit to inquire.&nbsp; English society appeared a gloomy
concretion enough to abide in as she contemplated it on this journey
home; yet, since its gloominess was less an essential quality than an
accident of her point of view, that point of view she had determined
to change.</p>
<p>There lay open to her two directions in which to move.&nbsp; She
might annex herself to the easy-going high by wedding an old nobleman,
or she might join for good and all the easy-going low, by plunging back
to the level of her family, giving up all her ambitions for them, settling
as the wife of a provincial music-master named Julian, with a little
shop of fiddles and flutes, a couple of old pianos, a few sheets of
stale music pinned to a string, and a narrow back parlour, wherein she
would wait for the phenomenon of a customer.&nbsp; And each of these
divergent grooves had its fascinations, till she reflected with regard
to the first that, even though she were a legal and indisputable Lady
Mountclere, she might be despised by my lord&rsquo;s circle, and left
lone and lorn.&nbsp; The intermediate path of accepting Neigh or Ladywell
had no more attractions for her taste than the fact of disappointing
them had qualms for her conscience; and how few these were may be inferred
from her opinion, true or false, that two words about the spigot on
her escutcheon would sweep her lovers&rsquo; affections to the antipodes.&nbsp;
She had now and then imagined that her previous intermarriage with the
Petherwin family might efface much besides her surname, but experience
proved that the having been wife for a few weeks to a minor who died
in his father&rsquo;s lifetime, did not weave such a tissue of glory
about her course as would resist a speedy undoing by startling confessions
on her station before her marriage, and her environments now.</p>
<h2>36. THE HOUSE IN TOWN</h2>
<p>Returning by way of Knollsea, where she remained a week or two, Ethelberta
appeared one evening at the end of September before her house in Exonbury
Crescent, accompanied by a pair of cabs with the children and luggage;
but Picotee was left at Knollsea, for reasons which Ethelberta explained
when the family assembled in conclave.&nbsp; Her father was there, and
began telling her of a surprising change in Menlove&mdash;an unasked-for
concession to their cause, and a vow of secrecy which he could not account
for, unless any friend of Ethelberta&rsquo;s had bribed her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;that cannot be,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; Any influence
of Lord Mountclere to that effect was the last thing that could enter
her thoughts.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, what Menlove does makes little difference
to me now.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she proceeded to state that she had almost
come to a decision which would entirely alter their way of living.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it will not be of the sort your last decision was,&rsquo;
said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; quite the reverse.&nbsp; I shall not live here in state
any longer.&nbsp; We will let the house throughout as lodgings, while
it is ours; and you and the girls must manage it.&nbsp; I will retire
from the scene altogether, and stay for the winter at Knollsea with
Picotee.&nbsp; I want to consider my plans for next year, and I would
rather be away from town.&nbsp; Picotee is left there, and I return
in two days with the books and papers I require.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are your plans to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to be a schoolmistress&mdash;I think I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A schoolmistress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And Picotee returns to the same occupation, which
she ought never to have forsaken.&nbsp; We are going to study arithmetic
and geography until Christmas; then I shall send her adrift to finish
her term as pupil-teacher, while I go into a training-school.&nbsp;
By the time I have to give up this house I shall just have got a little
country school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said her mother, aghast, &lsquo;why not write
more poems and sell &rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not be a governess as you were?&rsquo; said her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not go on with your tales at Mayfair Hall?&rsquo; said
Gwendoline.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll answer as well as I can.&nbsp; I have decided to
give up romancing because I cannot think of any more that pleases me.&nbsp;
I have been trying at Knollsea for a fortnight, and it is no use.&nbsp;
I will never be a governess again: I would rather be a servant.&nbsp;
If I am a schoolmistress I shall be entirely free from all contact with
the great, which is what I desire, for I hate them, and am getting almost
as revolutionary as Sol.&nbsp; Father, I cannot endure this kind of
existence any longer; I sleep at night as if I had committed a murder:
I start up and see processions of people, audiences, battalions of lovers
obtained under false pretences&mdash;all denouncing me with the finger
of ridicule.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s suggestion about my marrying I followed
out as far as dogged resolution would carry me, but during my journey
here I have broken down; for I don&rsquo;t want to marry a second time
among people who would regard me as an upstart or intruder.&nbsp; I
am sick of ambition.&nbsp; My only longing now is to fly from society
altogether, and go to any hovel on earth where I could be at peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;has anybody been insulting you?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; or rather I sometimes think he may have: that is, if
a proposal of marriage is only removed from being a proposal of a very
different kind by an accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A proposal of marriage can never be an insult,&rsquo; her
mother returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think otherwise,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless the man was beneath you, and I don&rsquo;t suppose
he was that,&rsquo; added Mrs. Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite right; he was not that.&nbsp; But we will not
talk of this branch of the subject.&nbsp; By far the most serious concern
with me is that I ought to do some good by marriage, or by heroic performance
of some kind; while going back to give the rudiments of education to
remote hamleteers will do none of you any good whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you mind us,&rsquo; said her father; &lsquo;mind yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall hardly be minding myself either, in your opinion,
by doing that,&rsquo; said Ethelberta dryly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it will
be more tolerable than what I am doing now.&nbsp; Georgina, and Myrtle,
and Emmeline, and Joey will not get the education I intended for them;
but that must go, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How full of vagaries you are,&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t it do to continue as you are?&nbsp; No sooner
have I learnt up your schemes, and got enough used to &rsquo;em to see
something in &rsquo;em, than you must needs bewilder me again by starting
some fresh one, so that my mind gets no rest at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta too keenly felt the justice of this remark, querulous
as it was, to care to defend herself.&nbsp; It was hopeless to attempt
to explain to her mother that the oscillations of her mind might arise
as naturally from the perfection of its balance, like those of a logan-stone,
as from inherent lightness; and such an explanation, however comforting
to its subject, was little better than none to simple hearts who only
could look to tangible outcrops.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Ethelberta,&rsquo; remonstrated her mother, &lsquo;this
is very odd.&nbsp; Making yourself miserable in trying to get a position
on our account is one thing, and not necessary; but I think it ridiculous
to rush into the other extreme, and go wilfully down in the scale.&nbsp;
You may just as well exercise your wits in trying to swim as in trying
to sink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what I think,&rsquo; said her father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But of course Berta knows best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so too,&rsquo; said Gwendoline.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so do I,&rsquo; said Cornelia.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had once
moved about in large circles like Ethelberta, I wouldn&rsquo;t go down
and be a schoolmistress&mdash;not I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I own it is foolish&mdash;suppose it is,&rsquo; said Ethelberta
wearily, and with a readiness of misgiving that showed how recent and
hasty was the scheme.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you are right, mother; anything
rather than retreat.&nbsp; I wonder if you are right!&nbsp; Well, I
will think again of it to-night.&nbsp; Do not let us speak more about
it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did think of it that night, very long and painfully.&nbsp; The
arguments of her relatives seemed ponderous as opposed to her own inconsequent
longing for escape from galling trammels.&nbsp; If she had stood alone,
the sentiment that she had begun to build but was not able to finish,
by whomsoever it might have been entertained, would have had few terrors;
but that the opinion should be held by her nearest of kin, to cause
them pain for life, was a grievous thing.&nbsp; The more she thought
of it, the less easy seemed the justification of her desire for obscurity.&nbsp;
From regarding it as a high instinct she passed into a humour that gave
that desire the appearance of a whim.&nbsp; But could she really set
in train events, which, if not abortive, would take her to the altar
with Viscount Mountclere?</p>
<p>In one determination she never faltered; to commit her sin thoroughly
if she committed it at all.&nbsp; Her relatives believed her choice
to lie between Neigh and Ladywell alone.&nbsp; But once having decided
to pass over Christopher, whom she had loved, there could be no pausing
for Ladywell because she liked him, or for Neigh in that she was influenced
by him.&nbsp; They were both too near her level to be trusted to bear
the shock of receiving her from her father&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; But
it was possible that though her genesis might tinge with vulgarity a
commoner&rsquo;s household, susceptible of such depreciation, it might
show as a picturesque contrast in the family circle of a peer.&nbsp;
Hence it was just as well to go to the end of her logic, where reasons
for tergiversation would be most pronounced.&nbsp; This thought of the
viscount, however, was a secret for her own breast alone.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of that night she sat weighing&mdash;first, the
question itself of marrying Lord Mountclere; and, at other times, whether,
for safety, she might marry him without previously revealing family
particulars hitherto held necessary to be revealed&mdash;a piece of
conduct she had once felt to be indefensible.&nbsp; The ingenious Ethelberta,
much more prone than the majority of women to theorize on conduct, felt
the need of some soothing defence of the actions involved in any ambiguous
course before finally committing herself to it.</p>
<p>She took down a well-known treatise on Utilitarianism which she had
perused once before, and to which she had given her adherence ere any
instance had arisen wherein she might wish to take it as a guide.&nbsp;
Here she desultorily searched for argument, and found it; but the application
of her author&rsquo;s philosophy to the marriage question was an operation
of her own, as unjustifiable as it was likely in the circumstances.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The ultimate end,&rsquo; she read, &lsquo;with
reference to and for the sake of which all other things are desirable
(whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is
an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible
in enjoyments, both in point of quantity and quality. . . .&nbsp; This
being, according to the utilitarian opinion, the end of human action,
is necessarily also the standard of morality.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was an open question, so far, whether her own happiness should
or should not be preferred to that of others.&nbsp; But that her personal
interests were not to be considered as paramount appeared further on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The happiness which forms the standard of what
is right in conduct is not the agent&rsquo;s own happiness but that
of all concerned.&nbsp; As between his own happiness and that of others,
utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested
and benevolent spectator.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to whose happiness was meant by that of &lsquo;other people,&rsquo;
&lsquo;all concerned,&rsquo; and so on, her luminous moralist soon enlightened
her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The occasions on which any person (except one
in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on an extended scale&mdash;in
other words, to be a public benefactor&mdash;are but exceptional; and
on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility;
in every other case private utility, the interest or happiness of some
few persons, is all he has to attend to.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that these few persons should be those endeared to her by every
domestic tie no argument was needed to prove.&nbsp; That their happiness
would be in proportion to her own well-doing, and power to remove their
risks of indigence, required no proving either to her now.</p>
<p>By a sorry but unconscious misapplication of sound and wide reasoning
did the active mind of Ethelberta thus find itself a solace.&nbsp; At
about the midnight hour she felt more fortified on the expediency of
marriage with Lord Mountclere than she had done at all since musing
on it.&nbsp; In respect of the second query, whether or not, in that
event, to conceal from Lord Mountclere the circumstances of her position
till it should be too late for him to object to them, she found her
conscience inconveniently in the way of her theory, and the oracle before
her afforded no hint.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah&mdash;it is a point for a casuist!&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>An old treatise on Casuistry lay on the top shelf.&nbsp; She opened
it&mdash;more from curiosity than from guidance this time, it must be
observed&mdash;at a chapter bearing on her own problem, &lsquo;The <i>disciplina
arcani</i>, or, the doctrine of reserve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here she read that there were plenty of apparent instances of this
in Scripture, and that it was formed into a recognized system in the
early Church.&nbsp; With reference to direct acts of deception, it was
argued that since there were confessedly cases where killing is no murder,
might there not be cases where lying is no sin?&nbsp; It could not be
right&mdash;or, indeed, anything but most absurd&mdash;to say in effect
that no doubt circumstances would occur where every sound man would
tell a lie, and would be a brute or a fool if he did not, and to say
at the same time that it is quite indefensible in principle.&nbsp; Duty
was the key to conduct then, and if in such cases duties appeared to
clash they would be found not to do so on examination.&nbsp; The lesser
duty would yield to the greater, and therefore ceased to be a duty.</p>
<p>This author she found to be not so tolerable; he distracted her.&nbsp;
She put him aside and gave over reading, having decided on this second
point, that she would, at any hazard, represent the truth to Lord Mountclere
before listening to another word from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, at last
I have done,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and am ready for my <i>r&ocirc;le</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In looking back upon her past as she retired to rest, Ethelberta
could almost doubt herself to be the identical woman with her who had
entered on a romantic career a few short years ago.&nbsp; For that doubt
she had good reason.&nbsp; She had begun as a poet of the Satanic school
in a sweetened form; she was ending as a pseudo-utilitarian.&nbsp; Was
there ever such a transmutation effected before by the action of a hard
environment?&nbsp; It was not without a qualm of regret that she discerned
how the last infirmity of a noble mind had at length nearly departed
from her.&nbsp; She wondered if her early notes had had the genuine
ring in them, or whether a poet who could be thrust by realities to
a distance beyond recognition as such was a true poet at all.&nbsp;
Yet Ethelberta&rsquo;s gradient had been regular: emotional poetry,
light verse, romance as an object, romance as a means, thoughts of marriage
as an aid to her pursuits, a vow to marry for the good of her family;
in other words, from soft and playful Romanticism to distorted Benthamism.&nbsp;
Was the moral incline upward or down?</p>
<h2>37. KNOLLSEA&mdash;AN ORNAMENTAL VILLA</h2>
<p>Her energies collected and fermented anew by the results of the vigil,
Ethelberta left town for Knollsea, where she joined Picotee the same
evening.&nbsp; Picotee produced a letter, which had been addressed to
her sister at their London residence, but was not received by her there,
Mrs. Chickerel having forwarded it to Knollsea the day before Ethelberta
arrived in town.</p>
<p>The crinkled writing, in character like the coast-line of Tierra
del Fuego, was becoming familiar by this time.&nbsp; While reading the
note she informed Picotee, between a quick breath and a rustle of frills,
that it was from Lord Mountclere, who wrote on the subject of calling
to see her, suggesting a day in the following week.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
Picotee,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;we shall have to receive him,
and make the most of him, for I have altered my plans since I was last
in Knollsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Altered them again?&nbsp; What are you going to be now&mdash;not
a poor person after all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed not.&nbsp; And so I turn and turn.&nbsp; Can you imagine
what Lord Mountclere is coming for?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t say what you
think.&nbsp; Before I reply to this letter we must go into new lodgings,
to give them as our address.&nbsp; The first business to-morrow morning
will be to look for the gayest house we can find; and Captain Flower
and this little cabin of his must be things we have never known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next day after breakfast they accordingly sallied forth.</p>
<p>Knollsea had recently begun to attract notice in the world.&nbsp;
It had this year undergone visitation from a score of professional gentlemen
and their wives, a minor canon, three marine painters, seven young ladies
with books in their hands, and nine-and-thirty babies.&nbsp; Hence a
few lodging-houses, of a dash and pretentiousness far beyond the mark
of the old cottages which formed the original substance of the village,
had been erected to meet the wants of such as these.&nbsp; To a building
of this class Ethelberta now bent her steps, and the crush of the season
having departed in the persons of three-quarters of the above-named
visitors, who went away by a coach, a van, and a couple of wagonettes
one morning, she found no difficulty in arranging for a red and yellow
streaked villa, which was so bright and glowing that the sun seemed
to be shining upon it even on a cloudy day, and the ruddiest native
looked pale when standing by its walls.&nbsp; It was not without regret
that she renounced the sailor&rsquo;s pretty cottage for this porticoed
and balconied dwelling; but her lines were laid down clearly at last,
and thither she removed forthwith.</p>
<p>From this brand-new house did Ethelberta pen the letter fixing the
time at which she would be pleased to see Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>When the hour drew nigh enormous force of will was required to keep
her perturbation down.&nbsp; She had not distinctly told Picotee of
the object of the viscount&rsquo;s visit, but Picotee guessed nearly
enough.&nbsp; Ethelberta was upon the whole better pleased that the
initiative had again come from him than if the first step in the new
campaign had been her sending the explanatory letter, as intended and
promised.&nbsp; She had thought almost directly after the interview
at Rouen that to enlighten him by writing a confession in cold blood,
according to her first intention, would be little less awkward for her
in the method of telling than in the facts to be told.</p>
<p>So the last hair was arranged and the last fold adjusted, and she
sat down to await a new page of her history.&nbsp; Picotee sat with
her, under orders to go into the next room when Lord Mountclere should
call; and Ethelberta determined to waste no time, directly he began
to make advances, in clearing up the phenomena of her existence to him;
to the end that no fact which, in the event of his taking her to wife,
could be used against her as an example of concealment, might remain
unrelated.&nbsp; The collapse of his attachment under the test might,
however, form the grand climax of such a play as this.</p>
<p>The day was rather cold for the season, and Ethelberta sat by a fire;
but the windows were open, and Picotee was amusing herself on the balcony
outside.&nbsp; The hour struck: Ethelberta fancied she could hear the
wheels of a carriage creeping up the steep ascent which led to the drive
before the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it he?&rsquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Picotee, whose indifference contrasted strangely
with the restlessness of her who was usually the coolest.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is a man shaking down apples in the garden over the wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They lingered on till some three or four minutes had gone by.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely that&rsquo;s a carriage?&rsquo; said Ethelberta, then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is,&rsquo; said Picotee outside, stretching her
neck forward as far as she could.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, it is the men on
the beach dragging up their boats; they expect wind to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How wearisome!&nbsp; Picotee, you may as well come inside;
if he means to call he will; but he ought to be here by this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was only once more, and that some time later that she again said
&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the noise of a carriage; it is the fizz of
a rocket.&nbsp; The coastguardsmen are practising the life-apparatus
to-day, to be ready for the autumn wrecks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, her face clearing up.&nbsp; Hers
had not been a sweetheart&rsquo;s impatience, but her mood had intensified
during these minutes of suspense to a harassing mistrust of her man-compelling
power, which was, if that were possible, more gloomy than disappointed
love.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know now where he is.&nbsp; That operation with
the cradle-apparatus is very interesting, and he is stopping to see
it. . . .&nbsp; But I shall not wait indoors much longer, whatever he
may be stopping to see.&nbsp; It is very unaccountable, and vexing,
after moving into this new house too.&nbsp; We were much more comfortable
in the old one.&nbsp; In keeping any previous appointment in which I
have been concerned he has been ridiculously early.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I run round?&rsquo; said Picotee, &lsquo;and if he is
not watching them we will go out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said her sister.</p>
<p>The time of Picotee&rsquo;s absence seemed an age.&nbsp; Ethelberta
heard the roar of another rocket, and still Picotee did not return.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What can the girl be thinking of?&rsquo; she mused. . . .&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a half-and-half policy mine has been!&nbsp; Thinking of
marrying for position, and yet not making it my rigid plan to secure
the man the first moment that he made his offer.&nbsp; So I lose the
comfort of having a soul above worldliness, and my compensation for
not having it likewise!&rsquo;&nbsp; A minute or two more and in came
Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has kept you so long&mdash;and how excited you look,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I would stay a little while, as I had never seen
a rocket-apparatus,&rsquo; said Picotee, faintly and strangely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is he there?&rsquo; asked her sister impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;he was.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; There is no old man there at all.&nbsp; Mr Julian
was there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; came from Ethelberta, like a note from
a storm-bird at night.&nbsp; She turned round and went into the back
room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Mr. Julian going to call here?&rsquo; she inquired,
coming forward again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone by the steamboat.&nbsp; He was only
passing through on his way to Sandbourne, where he is gone to settle
a small business relating to his father&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; He was
not in Knollsea ten minutes, owing to something which detained him on
the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he inquire for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; And only think, Ethelberta&mdash;such a remarkable
thing has happened, though I nearly forgot to tell you.&nbsp; He says
that coming along the road he was overtaken by a carriage, and when
it had just passed him one of the horses shied, pushed the other down
a slope, and overturned the carriage.&nbsp; One wheel came off and trundled
to the bottom of the hill by itself.&nbsp; Christopher of course ran
up, and helped out of the carriage an old gentleman&mdash;now do you
know what&rsquo;s likely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; I am glad that&rsquo;s the cause,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta involuntarily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagined you would suppose it to be Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
But Mr. Julian did not know the gentleman, and said nothing about who
he might be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he describe him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much&mdash;just a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said he was a sly old dog apparently, to hear how he swore
in whispers.&nbsp; This affair is what made Mr. Julian so late that
he had no time to call here.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s ankle&mdash;if
it was Lord Mountclere&mdash;was badly sprained.&nbsp; But the servants
were not injured beyond a scratch on the coachman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
Then they got another carriage and drove at once back again.&nbsp; It
must be he, or else why is he not come?&nbsp; It is a pity, too, that
Mr. Julian was hindered by this, so that there was no opportunity for
him to bide a bit in Knollsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta was not disposed to believe that Christopher would have
called, had time favoured him to the utmost.&nbsp; Between himself and
her there was that kind of division which is more insurmountable than
enmity; for estrangements produced by good judgment will last when those
of feeling break down in smiles.&nbsp; Not the lovers who part in passion,
but the lovers who part in friendship, are those who most frequently
part for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you tell Mr. Julian that the injured gentleman was possibly
Lord Mountclere, and that he was coming here?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I made no remark at all&mdash;I did not think of him till
afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The inquiry was hardly necessary, for Picotee&rsquo;s words would
dry away like a brook in the sands when she held conversation with Christopher.</p>
<p>As they had anticipated, the sufferer was no other than their intending
visitor.&nbsp; Next morning there was a note explaining the accident,
and expressing its writer&rsquo;s suffering from the cruel delay as
greater than that from the swollen ankle, which was progressing favourably.</p>
<p>Nothing further was heard of Lord Mountclere for more than a week,
when she received another letter, which put an end to her season of
relaxation, and once more braced her to the contest.&nbsp; This epistle
was very courteously written, and in point of correctness, propriety,
and gravity, might have come from the quill of a bishop.&nbsp; Herein
the old nobleman gave a further description of the accident, but the
main business of the communication was to ask her if, since he was not
as yet very active, she would come to Enckworth Court and delight himself
and a small group of friends who were visiting there.</p>
<p>She pondered over the letter as she walked by the shore that day,
and after some hesitation decided to go.</p>
<h2>38. ENCKWORTH COURT</h2>
<p>It was on a dull, stagnant, noiseless afternoon of autumn that Ethelberta
first crossed the threshold of Enckworth Court.&nbsp; The daylight was
so lowered by the impervious roof of cloud overhead that it scarcely
reached further into Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s entrance-hall than to the
splays of the windows, even but an hour or two after midday; and indoors
the glitter of the fire reflected itself from the very panes, so inconsiderable
were the opposing rays.</p>
<p>Enckworth Court, in its main part, had not been standing more than
a hundred years.&nbsp; At that date the weakened portions of the original
mediaeval structure were pulled down and cleared away, old jambs being
carried off for rick-staddles, and the foliated timbers of the hall
roof making themselves useful as fancy chairs in the summer-houses of
rising inns.&nbsp; A new block of masonry was built up from the ground
of such height and lordliness that the remnant of the old pile left
standing became as a mere cup-bearer and culinary menial beside it.&nbsp;
The rooms in this old fragment, which had in times past been considered
sufficiently dignified for dining-hall, withdrawing-room, and so on,
were now reckoned barely high enough for sculleries, servants&rsquo;
hall, and laundries, the whole of which were arranged therein.</p>
<p>The modern portion had been planned with such a total disregard of
association, that the very rudeness of the contrast gave an interest
to the mass which it might have wanted had perfect harmony been attempted
between the old nucleus and its adjuncts, a probable result if the enlargement
had taken place later on in time.&nbsp; The issue was that the hooded
windows, simple string-courses, and random masonry of the Gothic workman,
stood elbow to elbow with the equal-spaced ashlar, architraves, and
fasciae of the Classic addition, each telling its distinct tale as to
stage of thought and domestic habit without any of those artifices of
blending or restoration by which the seeker for history in stones will
be utterly hoodwinked in time to come.</p>
<p>To the left of the door and vestibule which Ethelberta passed through
rose the principal staircase, constructed of a freestone so milk-white
and delicately moulded as to be easily conceived in the lamplight as
of biscuit-ware.&nbsp; Who, unacquainted with the secrets of geometrical
construction, could imagine that, hanging so airily there, to all appearance
supported on nothing, were twenty or more tons dead weight of stone,
that would have made a prison for an elephant if so arranged?&nbsp;
The art which produced this illusion was questionable, but its success
was undoubted.&nbsp; &lsquo;How lovely!&rsquo; said Ethelberta, as she
looked at the fairy ascent.&nbsp; &lsquo;His staircase alone is worth
my hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Passing along by the colonnade, which partly fenced the staircase
from the visitor, the saloon was reached, an apartment forming a double
cube.&nbsp; About the left-hand end of this were grouped the drawing-rooms
and library; while on the right was the dining-hall, with billiard,
smoking, and gun rooms in mysterious remoteness beyond.</p>
<p>Without attempting to trace an analogy between a man and his mansion,
it may be stated that everything here, though so dignified and magnificent,
was not conceived in quite the true and eternal spirit of art.&nbsp;
It was a house in which Pugin would have torn his hair.&nbsp; Those
massive blocks of red-veined marble lining the hall&mdash;emulating
in their surface-glitter the Escalier de Marbre at Versailles&mdash;were
cunning imitations in paint and plaster by workmen brought from afar
for the purpose, at a prodigious expense, by the present viscount&rsquo;s
father, and recently repaired and re-varnished.&nbsp; The dark green
columns and pilasters corresponding were brick at the core.&nbsp; Nay,
the external walls, apparently of massive and solid freestone, were
only veneered with that material, being, like the pillars, of brick
within.</p>
<p>To a stone mask worn by a brick face a story naturally appertained&mdash;one
which has since done service in other quarters.&nbsp; When the vast
addition had just been completed King George visited Enckworth.&nbsp;
Its owner pointed out the features of its grand architectural attempt,
and waited for commendation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brick, brick, brick,&rsquo; said the king.</p>
<p>The Georgian Lord Mountclere blushed faintly, albeit to his very
poll, and said nothing more about his house that day.&nbsp; When the
king was gone he sent frantically for the craftsmen recently dismissed,
and soon the green lawns became again the colour of a Nine-Elms cement
wharf.&nbsp; Thin freestone slabs were affixed to the whole series of
fronts by copper cramps and dowels, each one of substance sufficient
to have furnished a poor boy&rsquo;s pocket with pennies for a month,
till not a speck of the original surface remained, and the edifice shone
in all the grandeur of massive masonry that was not massive at all.&nbsp;
But who remembered this save the builder and his crew? and as long as
nobody knew the truth, pretence looked just as well.</p>
<p>What was honest in Enckworth Court was that portion of the original
edifice which still remained, now degraded to subservient uses.&nbsp;
Where the untitled Mountclere of the White Rose faction had spread his
knees over the brands, when the place was a castle and not a court,
the still-room maid now simmered her preserves; and where Elizabethan
mothers and daughters of that sturdy line had tapestried the love-scenes
of Isaac and Jacob, boots and shoes were now cleaned and coals stowed
away.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere had so far recovered from the sprain as to be nominally
quite well, under pressure of a wish to receive guests.&nbsp; The sprain
had in one sense served him excellently.&nbsp; He had now a reason,
apart from that of years, for walking with his stick, and took care
to let the reason be frequently known.&nbsp; To-day he entertained a
larger number of persons than had been assembled within his walls for
a great length of time.</p>
<p>Until after dinner Ethelberta felt as if she were staying at an hotel.&nbsp;
Few of the people whom she had met at the meeting of the Imperial Association
greeted her here.&nbsp; The viscount&rsquo;s brother was not present,
but Sir Cyril Blandsbury and his wife were there, a lively pair of persons,
entertaining as actors, and friendly as dogs.&nbsp; Beyond these all
the faces and figures were new to her, though they were handsome and
dashing enough to satisfy a court chronicler.&nbsp; Ethelberta, in a
dress sloped about as high over the shoulder as would have drawn approval
from Reynolds, and expostulation from Lely, thawed and thawed each friend
who came near her, and sent him or her away smiling; yet she felt a
little surprise.&nbsp; She had seldom visited at a country-house, and
knew little of the ordinary composition of a group of visitors within
its walls; but the present assemblage seemed to want much of that old-fashioned
stability and quaint monumental dignity she had expected to find under
this historical roof.&nbsp; Nobody of her entertainer&rsquo;s own rank
appeared.&nbsp; Not a single clergyman was there.&nbsp; A tendency to
talk Walpolean scandal about foreign courts was particularly manifest.&nbsp;
And although tropical travellers, Indian officers and their wives, courteous
exiles, and descendants of Irish kings, were infinitely more pleasant
than Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s landed neighbours would probably have been,
to such a cosmopolite as Ethelberta a calm Tory or old Whig company
would have given a greater treat.&nbsp; They would have struck as gratefully
upon her senses as sylvan scenery after crags and cliffs, or silence
after the roar of a cataract.</p>
<p>It was evening, and all these personages at Enckworth Court were
merry, snug, and warm within its walls.&nbsp; Dinner-time had passed,
and everything had gone on well, when Mrs. Tara O&rsquo;Fanagan, who
had a gold-clamped tooth, which shone every now and then, asked Ethelberta
if she would amuse them by telling a story, since nobody present, except
Lord Mountclere, had ever heard one from her lips.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ethelberta had been working at that art as a profession,
it can hardly be said that the question was conceived with tact, though
it was put with grace.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere evidently thought it objectionable,
for he looked unhappy.&nbsp; To only one person in the brilliant room
did the request appear as a timely accident, and that was to Ethelberta
herself.&nbsp; Her honesty was always making war upon her manoeuvres,
and shattering their delicate meshes, to her great inconvenience and
delay.&nbsp; Thus there arose those devious impulses and tangential
flights which spoil the works of every would-be schemer who instead
of being wholly machine is half heart.&nbsp; One of these now was to
show herself as she really was, not only to Lord Mountclere, but to
his friends assembled, whom, in her ignorance, she respected more than
they deserved, and so get rid of that self-reproach which had by this
time reached a morbid pitch, through her over-sensitiveness to a situation
in which a large majority of women and men would have seen no falseness.</p>
<p>Full of this curious intention, she quietly assented to the request,
and laughingly bade them put themselves in listening order.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An old story will suit us,&rsquo; said the lady who had importuned
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have never heard one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; it shall be quite new,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
not yet made public; though it soon will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The narrative began by introducing to their notice a girl of the
poorest and meanest parentage, the daughter of a serving-man, and the
fifth of ten children.&nbsp; She graphically recounted, as if they were
her own, the strange dreams and ambitious longings of this child when
young, her attempts to acquire education, partial failures, partial
successes, and constant struggles; instancing how, on one of these occasions,
the girl concealed herself under a bookcase of the library belonging
to the mansion in which her father served as footman, and having taken
with her there, like a young Fawkes, matches and a halfpenny candle,
was going to sit up all night reading when the family had retired, until
her father discovered and prevented her scheme.&nbsp; Then followed
her experiences as nursery-governess, her evening lessons under self-selected
masters, and her ultimate rise to a higher grade among the teaching
sisterhood.&nbsp; Next came another epoch.&nbsp; To the mansion in which
she was engaged returned a truant son, between whom and the heroine
an attachment sprang up.&nbsp; The master of the house was an ambitious
gentleman just knighted, who, perceiving the state of their hearts,
harshly dismissed the homeless governess, and rated the son, the consequence
being that the youthful pair resolved to marry secretly, and carried
their resolution into effect.&nbsp; The runaway journey came next, and
then a moving description of the death of the young husband, and the
terror of the bride.</p>
<p>The guests began to look perplexed, and one or two exchanged whispers.&nbsp;
This was not at all the kind of story that they had expected; it was
quite different from her usual utterances, the nature of which they
knew by report.&nbsp; Ethelberta kept her eye upon Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
Soon, to her amazement, there was that in his face which told her that
he knew the story and its heroine quite well.&nbsp; When she delivered
the sentence ending with the professedly fictitious words: &lsquo;I
thus was reduced to great distress, and vainly cast about me for directions
what to do,&rsquo; Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s manner became so excited
and anxious that it acted reciprocally upon Ethelberta; her voice trembled,
she moved her lips but uttered nothing.&nbsp; To bring the story up
to the date of that very evening had been her intent, but it was beyond
her power.&nbsp; The spell was broken; she blushed with distress and
turned away, for the folly of a disclosure here was but too apparent.</p>
<p>Though every one saw that she had broken down, none of them appeared
to know the reason why, or to have the clue to her performance.&nbsp;
Fortunately Lord Mountclere came to her aid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let the first part end here,&rsquo; he said, rising and approaching
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been well entertained so far.&nbsp; I could
scarcely believe that the story I was listening to was utterly an invention,
so vividly does Mrs. Petherwin bring the scenes before our eyes.&nbsp;
She must now be exhausted; we will have the remainder to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed that this was well, and soon after fell into groups,
and dispersed about the rooms.&nbsp; When everybody&rsquo;s attention
was thus occupied Lord Mountclere whispered to Ethelberta tremulously,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell more: you think too much of them: they are no
better than you!&nbsp; Will you meet me in the little winter garden
two minutes hence?&nbsp; Pass through that door, and along the glass
passage.&rsquo;&nbsp; He himself left the room by an opposite door.</p>
<p>She had not set three steps in the warm snug octagon of glass and
plants when he appeared on the other side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You knew it all before!&rsquo; she said, looking keenly at
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who told you, and how long have you known it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before yesterday or last week,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Even before we met in France.&nbsp; Why are you so surprised?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta had been surprised, and very greatly, to find him, as
it were, secreted in the very rear of her position.&nbsp; That nothing
she could tell was new to him was a good deal to think of, but it was
little beside the recollection that he had actually made his first declaration
in the face of that knowledge of her which she had supposed so fatal
to all her matrimonial ambitions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now only one point remains to be settled,&rsquo; he said,
taking her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;You promised at Rouen that at our next
interview you would honour me with a decisive reply&mdash;one to make
me happy for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my father and friends?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are nothing to be concerned about.&nbsp; Modern developments
have shaken up the classes like peas in a hopper.&nbsp; An annuity,
and a comfortable cottage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brothers are workmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Manufacture is the single vocation in which a man&rsquo;s
prospects may be said to be illimitable.&nbsp; Hee-hee!&mdash;they may
buy me up before they die!&nbsp; And now what stands in the way?&nbsp;
It would take fifty alliances with fifty families so little disreputable
as yours, darling, to drag mine down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta had anticipated the scene, and settled her course; what
had to be said and done here was mere formality; yet she had been unable
to go straight to the assent required.&nbsp; However, after these words
of self-depreciation, which were let fall as much for her own future
ease of conscience as for his present warning, she made no more ado.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall think it a great honour to be your wife,&rsquo; she
said simply.</p>
<h2>39. KNOLLSEA&mdash;MELCHESTER</h2>
<p>The year was now moving on apace, but Ethelberta and Picotee chose
to remain at Knollsea, in the brilliant variegated brick and stone villa
to which they had removed in order to be in keeping with their ascending
fortunes.&nbsp; Autumn had begun to make itself felt and seen in bolder
and less subtle ways than at first.&nbsp; In the morning now, on coming
downstairs, in place of a yellowish-green leaf or two lying in a corner
of the lowest step, which had been the only previous symptoms around
the house, she saw dozens of them playing at corkscrews in the wind,
directly the door was opened.&nbsp; Beyond, towards the sea, the slopes
and scarps that had been muffled with a thick robe of cliff herbage,
were showing their chill grey substance through the withered verdure,
like the background of velvet whence the pile has been fretted away.&nbsp;
Unexpected breezes broomed and rasped the smooth bay in evanescent patches
of stippled shade, and, besides the small boats, the ponderous lighters
used in shipping stone were hauled up the beach in anticipation of the
equinoctial attack.</p>
<p>A few days after Ethelberta&rsquo;s reception at Enckworth, an improved
stanhope, driven by Lord Mountclere himself, climbed up the hill until
it was opposite her door.&nbsp; A few notes from a piano softly played
reached his ear as he descended from his place: on being shown in to
his betrothed, he could perceive that she had just left the instrument.&nbsp;
Moreover, a tear was visible in her eye when she came near him.</p>
<p>They discoursed for several minutes in the manner natural between
a defenceless young widow and an old widower in Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
position to whom she was plighted&mdash;a great deal of formal considerateness
making itself visible on her part, and of extreme tenderness on his.&nbsp;
While thus occupied, he turned to the piano, and casually glanced at
a piece of music lying open upon it.&nbsp; Some words of writing at
the top expressed that it was the composer&rsquo;s original copy, presented
by him, Christopher Julian, to the author of the song.&nbsp; Seeing
that he noticed the sheet somewhat lengthily, Ethelberta remarked that
it had been an offering made to her a long time ago&mdash;a melody written
to one of her own poems.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the writing of the composer,&rsquo; observed Lord Mountclere,
with interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;An offering from the musician himself&mdash;very
gratifying and touching.&nbsp; Mr. Christopher Julian is the name I
see upon it, I believe?&nbsp; I knew his father, Dr. Julian, a Sandbourne
man, if I recollect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ethelberta placidly.&nbsp; But it was really
with an effort.&nbsp; The song was the identical one which Christopher
sent up to her from Sandbourne when the fire of her hope burnt high
for less material ends; and the discovery of the sheet among her music
that day had started eddies of emotion for some time checked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you have been grieved,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere,
with gloomy restlessness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grieved?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I not see a tear there? or did my eyes deceive me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have seen one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! a tear, and a song.&nbsp; I think&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You naturally think that a woman who cries over a man&rsquo;s
gift must be in love with the giver?&rsquo;&nbsp; Ethelberta looked
him serenely in the face.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s jealous suspicions were considerably shaken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he said hastily, as if ashamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
who cries over a song is much affected by its sentiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you expect authors to cry over their own words?&rsquo;
she inquired, merging defence in attack.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid they
don&rsquo;t often do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would make me uneasy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, I would reassure you.&nbsp; Are you not still
doubting?&rsquo; she asked, with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot doubt you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swear, like a faithful knight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear, my fairy, my flower!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this the old man appeared to be pondering; indeed, his thoughts
could hardly be said to be present when he uttered the words.&nbsp;
For though the tabernacle was getting shaky by reason of years and merry
living, so that what was going on inside might often be guessed without
by the movement of the hangings, as in a puppet-show with worn canvas,
he could be quiet enough when scheming any plot of particular neatness,
which had less emotion than impishness in it.&nbsp; Such an innocent
amusement he was pondering now.</p>
<p>Before leaving her, he asked if she would accompany him to a morning
instrumental concert at Melchester, which was to take place in the course
of that week for the benefit of some local institution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Melchester,&rsquo; she repeated faintly, and observed him
as searchingly as it was possible to do without exposing herself to
a raking fire in return.&nbsp; Could he know that Christopher was living
there, and was this said in prolongation of his recent suspicion?&nbsp;
But Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s face gave no sign.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget one fatal objection,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;the
secrecy in which it is imperative that the engagement between us should
be kept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not known in Melchester without my carriage; nor are
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may be known by somebody on the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let it be arranged in this way.&nbsp; I will not call
here to take you up, but will meet you at the station at Anglebury;
and we can go on together by train without notice.&nbsp; Surely there
can be no objection to that?&nbsp; It would be mere prudishness to object,
since we are to become one so shortly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke a little
impatiently.&nbsp; It was plain that he particularly wanted her to go
to Melchester.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I merely meant that there was a chance of discovery in our
going out together.&nbsp; And discovery means no marriage.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She was pale now, and sick at heart, for it seemed that the viscount
must be aware that Christopher dwelt at that place, and was about to
test her concerning him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why does it mean no marriage?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father might, and almost certainly would, object to it.&nbsp;
Although he cannot control me, he might entreat me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why would he object?&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere uneasily,
and somewhat haughtily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will be my wife&mdash;say again that you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He breathed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He will not object&mdash;hee-hee!&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;O no&mdash;I think you will be mine now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have said so.&nbsp; But look to me all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You malign yourself, dear one.&nbsp; But you will meet me
at Anglebury, as I wish, and go on to Melchester with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be pleased to&mdash;if my sister may accompany me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;your sister.&nbsp; Yes, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They settled the time of the journey, and when the visit had been
stretched out as long as it reasonably could be with propriety, Lord
Mountclere took his leave.</p>
<p>When he was again seated on the driving-phaeton which he had brought
that day, Lord Mountclere looked gleeful, and shrewd enough in his own
opinion to outwit Mephistopheles.&nbsp; As soon as they were ascending
a hill, and he could find time to free his hand, he pulled off his glove,
and drawing from his pocket a programme of the Melchester concert referred
to, contemplated therein the name of one of the intended performers.&nbsp;
The name was that of Mr. C. Julian.&nbsp; Replacing it again, he looked
ahead, and some time after murmured with wily mirth, &lsquo;An excellent
test&mdash;a lucky thought!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing of importance occurred during the intervening days.&nbsp;
At two o&rsquo;clock on the appointed afternoon Ethelberta stepped from
the train at Melchester with the viscount, who had met her as proposed;
she was followed behind by Picotee.</p>
<p>The concert was to be held at the Town-hall half-an-hour later.&nbsp;
They entered a fly in waiting, and secure from recognition, were driven
leisurely in that direction, Picotee silent and absorbed with her own
thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the Cathedral,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere humorously,
as they caught a view of one of its towers through a street leading
into the Close.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It boasts of a very fine organ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the organist is a clever young man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere paused a moment or two.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the way,
you may remember that he is the Mr. Julian who set your song to music!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recollect it quite well.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her heart was horrified
and she thought Lord Mountclere must be developing into an inquisitor,
which perhaps he was.&nbsp; But none of this reached her face.</p>
<p>They turned in the direction of the Hall, were set down, and entered.</p>
<p>The large assembly-room set apart for the concert was upstairs, and
it was possible to enter it in two ways: by the large doorway in front
of the landing, or by turning down a side passage leading to council-rooms
and subsidiary apartments of small size, which were allotted to performers
in any exhibition; thus they could enter from one of these directly
upon the platform, without passing through the audience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you seat yourselves here?&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere,
who, instead of entering by the direct door, had brought the young women
round into this green-room, as it may be called.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see
we have come in privately enough; when the musicians arrive we can pass
through behind them, and step down to our seats from the front.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The players could soon be heard tuning in the next room.&nbsp; Then
one came through the passage-room where the three waited, and went in,
then another, then another.&nbsp; Last of all came Julian.</p>
<p>Ethelberta sat facing the door, but Christopher, never in the least
expecting her there, did not recognize her till he was quite inside.&nbsp;
When he had really perceived her to be the one who had troubled his
soul so many times and long, the blood in his face&mdash;never very
much&mdash;passed off and left it, like the shade of a cloud.&nbsp;
Between them stood a table covered with green baize, which, reflecting
upwards a band of sunlight shining across the chamber, flung upon his
already white features the virescent hues of death.&nbsp; The poor musician,
whose person, much to his own inconvenience, constituted a complete
breviary of the gentle emotions, looked as if he were going to fall
down in a faint.</p>
<p>Ethelberta flung at Lord Mountclere a look which clipped him like
pincers: he never forgot it as long as he lived.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is your pretty jealous scheme&mdash;I see it!&rsquo;
she hissed to him, and without being able to control herself went across
to Julian.</p>
<p>But a slight gasp came from behind the door where Picotee had been
sitting.&nbsp; Ethelberta and Lord Mountclere looked that way: and behold,
Picotee had nearly swooned.</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s show of passion went as quickly as it had come,
for she felt that a splendid triumph had been put into her hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now do you see the truth?&rsquo; she whispered to Lord Mountclere
without a drachm of feeling; pointing to Christopher and then to Picotee&mdash;as
like as two snowdrops now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do, I do,&rsquo; murmured the viscount hastily.</p>
<p>They both went forward to help Christopher in restoring the fragile
Picotee: he had set himself to that task as suddenly as he possibly
could to cover his own near approach to the same condition.&nbsp; Not
much help was required, the little girl&rsquo;s indisposition being
quite momentary, and she sat up in the chair again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you better?&rsquo; said Ethelberta to Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite well&mdash;quite,&rsquo; he said, smiling faintly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am glad to see you.&nbsp; I must, I think, go into the next
room now.&rsquo;&nbsp; He bowed and walked out awkwardly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you better, too?&rsquo; she said to Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite well,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite sure you know between whom the love lies now&mdash;eh?&rsquo;
Ethelberta asked in a sarcastic whisper of Lord Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am&mdash;beyond a doubt,&rsquo; murmured the anxious nobleman;
he feared that look of hers, which was not less dominant than irresistible.</p>
<p>Some additional moments given to thought on the circumstances rendered
Ethelberta still more indignant and intractable.&nbsp; She went out
at the door by which they had entered, along the passage, and down the
stairs.&nbsp; A shuffling footstep followed, but she did not turn her
head.&nbsp; When they reached the bottom of the stairs the carriage
had gone, their exit not being expected till two hours later.&nbsp;
Ethelberta, nothing daunted, swept along the pavement and down the street
in a turbulent prance, Lord Mountclere trotting behind with a jowl reduced
to a mere nothing by his concern at the discourtesy into which he had
been lured by jealous whisperings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest&mdash;forgive me; I confess I doubted you&mdash;but
I was beside myself,&rsquo; came to her ears from over her shoulder.&nbsp;
But Ethelberta walked on as before.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere sighed like a poet over a ledger.&nbsp; &lsquo;An
old man&mdash;who is not very old&mdash;naturally torments himself with
fears of losing&mdash;no, no&mdash;it was an innocent jest of mine&mdash;you
will forgive a joke&mdash;hee-hee?&rsquo; he said again, on getting
no reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had no right to mistrust me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not&mdash;you did not blench.&nbsp; You should have told
me before that it was your sister and not yourself who was entangled
with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You brought me to Melchester on purpose to confront him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you not ashamed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am satisfied.&nbsp; It is better to know the truth by any
means than to die of suspense; better for us both&mdash;surely you see
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had by this time got to the end of a long street, and into a
deserted side road by which the station could be indirectly reached.&nbsp;
Picotee appeared in the distance as a mere distracted speck of girlhood,
following them because not knowing what else to do in her sickness of
body and mind.&nbsp; Once out of sight here, Ethelberta began to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ethelberta,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere, in an agony of trouble,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t be vexed!&nbsp; It was an inconsiderate trick&mdash;I
own it.&nbsp; Do what you will, but do not desert me now!&nbsp; I could
not bear it&mdash;you would kill me if you were to leave me.&nbsp; Anything,
but be mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta continued her way, and drying her eyes entered the station,
where, on searching the time-tables, she found there would be no train
for Anglebury for the next two hours.&nbsp; Then more slowly she turned
towards the town again, meeting Picotee and keeping in her company.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere gave up the chase, but as he wished to get into the
town again, he followed in the same direction.&nbsp; When Ethelberta
had proceeded as far as the Red Lion Hotel, she turned towards it with
her companion, and being shown to a room, the two sisters shut themselves
in.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere paused and entered the White Hart, the rival
hotel to the Red Lion, which stood in an adjoining street.</p>
<p>Having secluded himself in an apartment here, walked from window
to window awhile, and made himself generally uncomfortable, he sat down
to the writing materials on the table, and concocted a note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;WHITE HART HOTEL.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MY DEAR MRS. PETHERWIN,&mdash;You do not mean to be so cruel
as to break your plighted word to me?&nbsp; Remember, there is no love
without much jealousy, and lovers are ever full of sighs and misgiving.&nbsp;
I have owned to as much contrition as can reasonably be expected.&nbsp;
I could not endure the suspicion that you loved another.&mdash;Yours
always,</p>
<p>&lsquo;MOUNTCLERE.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This he sent, watching from the window its progress along the street.&nbsp;
He awaited anxiously for an answer, and waited long.&nbsp; It was nearly
twenty minutes before he could hear a messenger approaching the door.&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;she had actually sent a reply; he prized it as if it had been
the first encouragement he had ever in his life received from woman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY LORD&rsquo; (wrote Ethelberta),&mdash;&lsquo;I
am not prepared at present to enter into the question of marriage at
all. The incident which has occurred affords me every excuse for withdrawing
my promise, since it was given under misapprehensions on a point that
materially affects my happiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;E. PETHERWIN.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ho-ho-ho&mdash;Miss Hoity-toity!&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere,
trotting up and down.&nbsp; But, remembering it was her June against
his November, this did not last long, and he frantically replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DARLING,&mdash;I cannot release you&mdash;I
must do anything to keep my treasure.&nbsp; Will you not see me for
a few minutes, and let bygones go to the winds?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was ever a thrush so safe in a cherry net before!</p>
<p>The messenger came back with the information that Mrs. Petherwin
had taken a walk to the Close, her companion alone remaining at the
hotel.&nbsp; There being nothing else left for the viscount to do, he
put on his hat, and went out on foot in the same direction.&nbsp; He
had not walked far when he saw Ethelberta moving slowly along the High
Street before him.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was at this hour wandering without any fixed intention
beyond that of consuming time.&nbsp; She was very wretched, and very
indifferent: the former when thinking of her past, the latter when thinking
of the days to come.&nbsp; While she walked thus unconscious of the
streets, and their groups of other wayfarers, she saw Christopher emerge
from a door not many paces in advance, and close it behind him: he stood
for a moment on the step before descending into the road.</p>
<p>She could not, even had she wished it, easily check her progress
without rendering the chance of his perceiving her still more certain.&nbsp;
But she did not wish any such thing, and it made little difference,
for he had already seen her in taking his survey round, and came down
from the door to her side.&nbsp; It was impossible for anything formal
to pass between them now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not at the concert, Mr. Julian?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am glad to have a better opportunity of speaking to you, and
of asking for your sister.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is not time for
us to call upon her to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, but it makes no difference,&rsquo; said Julian,
with somewhat sad reserve.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will tell her I have met you;
she is away from home just at present.&rsquo;&nbsp; And finding that
Ethelberta did not rejoin immediately he observed, &lsquo;The chief
organist, old Dr. Breeve, has taken my place at the concert, as it was
arranged he should do after the opening part.&nbsp; I am now going to
the Cathedral for the afternoon service.&nbsp; You are going there too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought of looking at the interior for a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went on side by side, saying little; for it was a situation
in which scarcely any appropriate thing could be spoken.&nbsp; Ethelberta
was the less reluctant to walk in his company because of the provocation
to skittishness that Lord Mountclere had given, a provocation which
she still resented.&nbsp; But she was far from wishing to increase his
jealousy; and yet this was what she was doing, Lord Mountclere being
a perturbed witness from behind of all that was passing now.</p>
<p>They turned the corner of the short street of connection which led
under an archway to the Cathedral Close, the old peer dogging them still.&nbsp;
Christopher seemed to warm up a little, and repeated the invitation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You will come with your sister to see us before you leave?&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have tea at six.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall have left Melchester before that time.&nbsp; I am
now only waiting for the train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You two have not come all the way from Knollsea alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Part of the way,&rsquo; said Ethelberta evasively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And going back alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Only for the last five miles.&nbsp; At least that
was the arrangement&mdash;I am not quite sure if it holds good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t wish me to see you safely in the train?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not necessary: thank you very much.&nbsp; We are well
used to getting about the world alone, and from Melchester to Knollsea
is no serious journey, late or early. . . .&nbsp; Yet I think I ought,
in honesty, to tell you that we are not entirely by ourselves in Melchester
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember I saw your friend&mdash;relative&mdash;in the room
at the Town-hall.&nbsp; It did not occur to my mind for the moment that
he was any other than a stranger standing there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not a relative,&rsquo; she said, with perplexity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hardly know, Christopher, how to explain to you my position
here to-day, because of some difficulties that have arisen since we
have been in the town, which may alter it entirely.&nbsp; On that account
I will be less frank with you than I should like to be, considering
how long we have known each other.&nbsp; It would be wrong, however,
if I were not to tell you that there has been a possibility of my marriage
with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The elderly gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And I came here in his company, intending to return
with him.&nbsp; But you shall know all soon.&nbsp; Picotee shall write
to Faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always think the Cathedral looks better from this point
than from the point usually chosen by artists,&rsquo; he said, with
nervous quickness, directing her glance upwards to the silent structure,
now misty and unrelieved by either high light or deep shade.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
get the grouping of the chapels and choir-aisles more clearly shown&mdash;and
the whole culminates to a more perfect pyramid from this spot&mdash;do
you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little further, and Christopher stopped to enter, when Ethelberta
bade him farewell.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought at one time that our futures
might have been different from what they are apparently becoming,&rsquo;
he said then, regarding her as a stall-reader regards the brilliant
book he cannot afford to buy.&nbsp; &lsquo;But one gets weary of repining
about that.&nbsp; I wish Picotee and yourself could see us oftener;
I am as confirmed a bachelor now as Faith is an old maid.&nbsp; I wonder
if&mdash;should the event you contemplate occur&mdash;you and he will
ever visit us, or we shall ever visit you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher was evidently imagining the elderly gentleman to be some
retired farmer, or professional man already so intermixed with the metamorphic
classes of society as not to be surprised or inconvenienced by her beginnings;
one who wished to secure Ethelberta as an ornament to his parlour fire
in a quiet spirit, and in no intoxicated mood regardless of issues.&nbsp;
She could scarcely reply to his supposition; and the parting was what
might have been predicted from a conversation so carefully controlled.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, as she had intended, now went on further, and entering
the nave began to inspect the sallow monuments which lined the grizzled
pile.&nbsp; She did not perceive amid the shadows an old gentleman who
had crept into the mouldy place as stealthily as a worm into a skull,
and was keeping himself carefully beyond her observation.&nbsp; She
continued to regard feature after feature till the choristers had filed
in from the south side, and peals broke forth from the organ on the
black oaken mass at the junction of nave and choir, shaking every cobweb
in the dusky vaults, and Ethelberta&rsquo;s heart no less.&nbsp; She
knew the fingers that were pressing out those rolling sounds, and knowing
them, became absorbed in tracing their progress.&nbsp; To go towards
the organ-loft was an act of unconsciousness, and she did not pause
till she stood almost beneath it.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was awakened from vague imaginings by the close approach
of the old gentleman alluded to, who spoke with a great deal of agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been trying to meet with you,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, let us be friends again!&mdash;Ethelberta, I MUST not lose
you!&nbsp; You cannot mean that the engagement shall be broken off?&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was far too desirous to possess her at any price now to run a second
risk of exasperating her, and forbore to make any allusion to the recent
pantomime between herself and Christopher that he had beheld, though
it might reasonably have filled him with dread and petulance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not mean anything beyond this,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that
I entirely withdraw from it on the faintest sign that you have not abandoned
such miserable jealous proceedings as those you adopted to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have quite abandoned them.&nbsp; Will you come a little
further this way, and walk in the aisle?&nbsp; You do still agree to
be mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it gives you any pleasure, I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; I implore that the marriage may be soon&mdash;very
soon.&rsquo;&nbsp; The viscount spoke hastily, for the notes of the
organ which were plunging into their ears ever and anon from the hands
of his young rival seemed inconveniently and solemnly in the way of
his suit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Lord Mountclere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say in a few days?&mdash;it is the only thing that will satisfy
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am absolutely indifferent as to the day.&nbsp; If it pleases
you to have it early I am willing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dare I ask that it may be this week?&rsquo; said the delighted
old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not say that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can name the earliest day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot now.&nbsp; We had better be going from here, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cathedral was filling with shadows, and cold breathings came
round the piers, for it was November, when night very soon succeeds
noon in spots where noon is sobered to the pallor of eve.&nbsp; But
the service was not yet over, and before quite leaving the building
Ethelberta cast one other glance towards the organ and thought of him
behind it.&nbsp; At this moment her attention was arrested by the form
of her sister Picotee, who came in at the north door, closed the lobby-wicket
softly, and went lightly forward to the choir.&nbsp; When within a few
yards of it she paused by a pillar, and lingered there looking up at
the organ as Ethelberta had done.&nbsp; No sound was coming from the
ponderous mass of tubes just then; but in a short space a whole crowd
of tones spread from the instrument to accompany the words of a response.&nbsp;
Picotee started at the burst of music as if taken in a dishonest action,
and moved on in a manner intended to efface the lover&rsquo;s loiter
of the preceding moments from her own consciousness no less than from
other people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you see that?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
little figure is my dearest sister.&nbsp; Could you but ensure a marriage
between her and him she listens to, I would do anything you wish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is indeed a gracious promise,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And would you agree to what I asked just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo;&nbsp; A gleeful spark accompanied this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you requested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This week?&nbsp; The day after to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will.&nbsp; But remember what lies on your side of
the contract.&nbsp; I fancy I have given you a task beyond your powers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, darling, we are at one at last,&rsquo; said Lord Mountclere,
rubbing his hand against his side.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if my task is heavy
and I cannot guarantee the result, I can make it very probable.&nbsp;
Marry me on Friday&mdash;the day after to-morrow&mdash;and I will do
all that money and influence can effect to bring about their union.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You solemnly promise?&nbsp; You will never cease to give me
all the aid in your power until the thing is done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do solemnly promise&mdash;on the conditions named.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good.&nbsp; You will have ensured my fulfilment of my
promise before I can ensure yours; but I take your word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will marry me on Friday!&nbsp; Give me your hand upon
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it a covenant?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere warmed from surface to centre as if he had drunk
of hippocras, and, after holding her hand for some moments, raised it
gently to his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two days and you are mine,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I believe I never shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never shall be?&nbsp; Why, darling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Some catastrophe will prevent it.&nbsp;
I shall be dead perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You distress me.&nbsp; Ah,&mdash;you meant me&mdash;you meant
that I should be dead, because you think I am old!&nbsp; But that is
a mistake&mdash;I am not very old!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought only of myself&mdash;nothing of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; Dearest, it is dismal and chilling here&mdash;let
us go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta mechanically moved with him, and felt there was no retreating
now.&nbsp; In the meantime the young ladykin whom the solemn vowing
concerned had lingered round the choir screen, as if fearing to enter,
yet loth to go away.&nbsp; The service terminated, the heavy books were
closed, doors were opened, and the feet of the few persons who had attended
evensong began pattering down the paved alleys.&nbsp; Not wishing Picotee
to know that the object of her secret excursion had been discovered,
Ethelberta now stepped out of the west doorway with the viscount before
Picotee had emerged from the other; and they walked along the path together
until she overtook them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear it becomes necessary for me to stay in Melchester to-night,&rsquo;
said Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a few matters to attend to
here, as the result of our arrangements.&nbsp; But I will first accompany
you as far as Anglebury, and see you safely into a carriage there that
shall take you home.&nbsp; To-morrow I will drive to Knollsea, when
we will make the final preparations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta would not have him go so far and back again, merely to
attend upon her; hence they parted at the railway, with due and correct
tenderness; and when the train had gone, Lord Mountclere returned into
the town on the special business he had mentioned, for which there remained
only the present evening and the following morning, if he were to call
upon her in the afternoon of the next day&mdash;the day before the wedding&mdash;now
so recklessly hastened on his part, and so coolly assented to on hers.</p>
<p>By the time that the two young people had started it was nearly dark.&nbsp;
Some portions of the railway stretched through little copses and plantations
where, the leaf-shedding season being now at its height, red and golden
patches of fallen foliage lay on either side of the rails; and as the
travellers passed, all these death-stricken bodies boiled up in the
whirlwind created by the velocity, and were sent flying right and left
of them in myriads, a clean-fanned track being left behind.</p>
<p>Picotee was called from the observation of these phenomena by a remark
from her sister: &lsquo;Picotee, the marriage is to be very early indeed.&nbsp;
It is to be the day after to-morrow&mdash;if it can.&nbsp; Nevertheless
I don&rsquo;t believe in the fact&mdash;I cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you arrange it so?&nbsp; Nobody can make you marry so
soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agreed to the day,&rsquo; murmured Ethelberta languidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can it be?&nbsp; The gay dresses and the preparations
and the people&mdash;how can they be collected in the time, Berta?&nbsp;
And so much more of that will be required for a lord of the land than
for a common man.&nbsp; O, I can&rsquo;t think it possible for a sister
of mine to marry a lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet it has been possible any time this last month or two,
strange as it seems to you. . . .&nbsp; It is to be not only a plain
and simple wedding, without any lofty appliances, but a secret one&mdash;as
secret as if I were some under-age heiress to an Indian fortune, and
he a young man of nothing a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Lord Mountclere said it must be so private?&nbsp; I suppose
it is on account of his family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I say so; and it is on account of my family.&nbsp;
Father might object to the wedding, I imagine, from what he once said,
or he might be much disturbed about it; so I think it better that he
and the rest should know nothing till all is over.&nbsp; You must dress
again as my sister to-morrow, dear.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere is going to
pay us an early visit to conclude necessary arrangements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, the life as a lady at Enckworth Court!&nbsp; The flowers,
the woods, the rooms, the pictures, the plate, and the jewels!&nbsp;
Horses and carriages rattling and prancing, seneschals and pages, footmen
hopping up and hopping down.&nbsp; It will be glory then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We might hire our father as one of my retainers, to increase
it,&rsquo; said Ethelberta drily.</p>
<p>Picotee&rsquo;s countenance fell.&nbsp; &lsquo;How shall we manage
all about that?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis terrible, really!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The marriage granted, those things will right themselves by
time and weight of circumstances.&nbsp; You take a wrong view in thinking
of glories of that sort.&nbsp; My only hope is that my life will be
quite private and simple, as will best become my inferiority and Lord
Mountclere&rsquo;s staidness.&nbsp; Such a splendid library as there
is at Enckworth, Picotee&mdash;quartos, folios, history, verse, Elzevirs,
Caxtons&mdash;all that has been done in literature from Moses down to
Scott&mdash;with such companions I can do without all other sorts of
happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will not go to town from Easter to Lammastide, as
other noble ladies do?&rsquo; asked the younger girl, rather disappointed
at this aspect of a viscountess&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will give dinners, and travel, and go to see his friends,
and have them to see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you not be, then, as any other peeress; and shall not
I be as any other peeress&rsquo;s sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That, too, I do not know.&nbsp; All is mystery.&nbsp; Nor
do I even know that the marriage will take place.&nbsp; I feel that
it may not; and perhaps so much the better, since the man is a stranger
to me.&nbsp; I know nothing whatever of his nature, and he knows nothing
of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>40. MELCHESTER (continued)</h2>
<p>The commotion wrought in Julian&rsquo;s mind by the abrupt incursion
of Ethelberta into his quiet sphere was thorough and protracted.&nbsp;
The witchery of her presence he had grown strong enough to withstand
in part; but her composed announcement that she had intended to marry
another, and, as far as he could understand, was intending it still,
added a new chill to the old shade of disappointment which custom was
day by day enabling him to endure.&nbsp; During the whole interval in
which he had produced those diapason blasts, heard with such inharmonious
feelings by the three auditors outside the screen, his thoughts had
wandered wider than his notes in conjectures on the character and position
of the gentleman seen in Ethelberta&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Owing to
his assumption that Lord Mountclere was but a stranger who had accidentally
come in at the side door, Christopher had barely cast a glance upon
him, and the wide difference between the years of the viscount and those
of his betrothed was not so particularly observed as to raise that point
to an item in his objections now.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere was dressed
with all the cunning that could be drawn from the metropolis by money
and reiterated dissatisfaction; he prided himself on his upright carriage;
his stick was so thin that the most malevolent could not insinuate that
it was of any possible use in walking; his teeth had put on all the
vigour and freshness of a second spring.&nbsp; Hence his look was the
slowest of possible clocks in respect of his age, and his manner was
equally as much in the rear of his appearance.</p>
<p>Christopher was now over five-and-twenty.&nbsp; He was getting so
well accustomed to the spectacle of a world passing him by and splashing
him with its wheels that he wondered why he had ever minded it.&nbsp;
His habit of dreaming instead of doing had led him up to a curious discovery.&nbsp;
It is no new thing for a man to fathom profundities by indulging humours:
the active, the rapid, the people of splendid momentum, have been surprised
to behold what results attend the lives of those whose usual plan for
discharging their active labours has been to postpone them indefinitely.&nbsp;
Certainly, the immediate result in the present case was, to all but
himself, small and invisible; but it was of the nature of highest things.&nbsp;
What he had learnt was that a woman who has once made a permanent impression
upon a man cannot altogether deny him her image by denying him her company,
and that by sedulously cultivating the acquaintance of this Creature
of Contemplation she becomes to him almost a living soul.&nbsp; Hence
a sublimated Ethelberta accompanied him everywhere&mdash;one who never
teased him, eluded him, or disappointed him: when he smiled she smiled,
when he was sad she sorrowed.&nbsp; He may be said to have become the
literal duplicate of that whimsical unknown rhapsodist who wrote of
his own similar situation&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;By absence this good means I gain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I can catch her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where none can watch her,<br />
In some close corner of my brain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There I embrace and kiss her;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I both enjoy and miss her.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This frame of mind naturally induced an amazing abstraction in the
organist, never very vigilant at the best of times.&nbsp; He would stand
and look fixedly at a frog in a shady pool, and never once think of
batrachians, or pause by a green bank to split some tall blade of grass
into filaments without removing it from its stalk, passing on ignorant
that he had made a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails of a graceful slip of vegetation.&nbsp;
He would hear the cathedral clock strike one, and go the next minute
to see what time it was.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never seed such a man as Mr.
Julian is,&rsquo; said the head blower.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll meet
me anywhere out-of-doors, and never wink or nod.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d hardly
expect it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t find fault, but you&rsquo;d hardly expect
it, seeing how I play the same instrument as he do himself, and have
done it for so many years longer than he.&nbsp; How I have indulged
that man, too!&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis Pedals for two martel hours of practice
I never complain; and he has plenty of vagaries.&nbsp; When &rsquo;tis
hot summer weather there&rsquo;s nothing will do for him but Choir,
Great, and Swell altogether, till yer face is in a vapour; and on a
frosty winter night he&rsquo;ll keep me there while he tweedles upon
the Twelfth and Sixteenth till my arms be scrammed for want of motion.&nbsp;
And never speak a word out-of-doors.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somebody suggested
that perhaps Christopher did not notice his coadjutor&rsquo;s presence
in the street; and time proved to the organ-blower that the remark was
just.</p>
<p>Whenever Christopher caught himself at these vacuous tricks he would
be struck with admiration of Ethelberta&rsquo;s wisdom, foresight, and
self-command in refusing to wed such an incapable man: he felt that
he ought to be thankful that a bright memory of her was not also denied
to him, and resolved to be content with it as a possession, since it
was as much of her as he could decently maintain.</p>
<p>Wrapped thus in a humorous sadness he passed the afternoon under
notice, and in the evening went home to Faith, who still lived with
him, and showed no sign of ever being likely to do otherwise.&nbsp;
Their present place and mode of life suited her well.&nbsp; She revived
at Melchester like an exotic sent home again.&nbsp; The leafy Close,
the climbing buttresses, the pondering ecclesiastics, the great doors,
the singular keys, the whispered talk, echoes of lonely footsteps, the
sunset shadow of the tall steeple, reaching further into the town than
the good bishop&rsquo;s teaching, and the general complexion of a spot
where morning had the stillness of evening and spring some of the tones
of autumn, formed a proper background to a person constituted as Faith,
who, like Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon&rsquo;s chicken, possessed in miniature
all the antiquity of her progenitors.</p>
<p>After tea Christopher went into the streets, as was frequently his
custom, less to see how the world crept on there than to walk up and
down for nothing at all.&nbsp; It had been market-day, and remnants
of the rural population that had visited the town still lingered at
corners, their toes hanging over the edge of the pavement, and their
eyes wandering about the street.</p>
<p>The angle which formed the turning-point of Christopher&rsquo;s promenade
was occupied by a jeweller&rsquo;s shop, of a standing which completely
outshone every other shop in that or any trade throughout the town.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was a staple subject of discussion in Melchester how a shop
of such pretensions could find patronage sufficient to support its existence
in a place which, though well populated, was not fashionable.&nbsp;
It had not long been established there, and was the enterprise of an
incoming man whose whole course of procedure seemed to be dictated by
an intention to astonish the native citizens very considerably before
he had done.&nbsp; Nearly everything was glass in the frontage of this
fairy mart, and its contents glittered like the hammochrysos stone.&nbsp;
The panes being of plate-glass, and the shop having two fronts, a diagonal
view could be had through it from one to the other of the streets to
which it formed a corner.</p>
<p>This evening, as on all evenings, a flood of radiance spread from
the window-lamps into the thick autumn air, so that from a distance
that corner appeared as the glistening nucleus of all the light in the
town.&nbsp; Towards it idle men and women unconsciously bent their steps,
and closed in upon the panes like night-birds upon the lantern of a
lighthouse.</p>
<p>When Christopher reached the spot there stood close to the pavement
a plain close carriage, apparently waiting for some person who was purchasing
inside.&nbsp; Christopher would hardly have noticed this had he not
also perceived, pressed against the glass of the shop window, an unusual
number of local noses belonging to overgrown working lads, tosspots,
an idiot, the ham-smoker&rsquo;s assistant with his sleeves rolled up,
a scot-and-lot freeholder, three or four seamstresses, the young woman
who brought home the washing, and so on.&nbsp; The interest of these
gazers in some proceedings within, which by reason of the gaslight were
as public as if carried on in the open air, was very great.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s a buying o&rsquo;&mdash;haw,
haw!&rsquo; said one of the young men, as the shopman removed from the
window a gorgeous blue velvet tray of wedding-rings, and laid it on
the counter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis what you may come to yerself, sooner or later,
God have mercy upon ye; and as such no scoffing matter,&rsquo; said
an older man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Faith, I&rsquo;d as lief cry as laugh to
see a man in that corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a gent getting up in years too.&nbsp; He must hev
been through it a few times afore, seemingly, to sit down and buy the
tools so cool as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&nbsp; See what the shyest will do at such times.&nbsp;
You bain&rsquo;t yerself then; no man living is hisself then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said the ham-smoker&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
a thought to look at that a chap will take all this trouble to get a
woman into his house, and a twelvemonth after would as soon hear it
thunder as hear her sing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The policeman standing near was a humane man, through having a young
family he could hardly keep, and he hesitated about telling them to
move on.&nbsp; Christopher had before this time perceived that the articles
were laid down before an old gentleman who was seated in the shop, and
that the gentleman was none other than he who had been with Ethelberta
in the concert-room.&nbsp; The discovery was so startling that, constitutionally
indisposed as he was to stand and watch, he became as glued to the spot
as the other idlers.&nbsp; Finding himself now for the first time directly
confronting the preliminaries of Ethelberta&rsquo;s marriage to a stranger,
he was left with far less equanimity than he could have supposed possible
to the situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So near the time!&rsquo; he said, and looked hard at Lord
Mountclere.</p>
<p>Christopher had now a far better opportunity than before for observing
Ethelberta&rsquo;s betrothed.&nbsp; Apart from any bias of jealousy,
disappointment, or mortification, he was led to judge that this was
not quite the man to make Ethelberta happy.&nbsp; He had fancied her
companion to be a man under fifty; he was now visibly sixty or more.&nbsp;
And it was not the sort of sexagenarianism beside which a young woman&rsquo;s
happiness can sometimes contrive to keep itself alive in a quiet sleepy
way.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to him that this was the man whom he
had helped in the carriage accident on the way to Knollsea.&nbsp; He
looked again.</p>
<p>By no means undignified, the face presented that combination of slyness
and jocundity which we are accustomed to imagine of the canonical jolly-dogs
in mediaeval tales.&nbsp; The gamesome Curate of Meudon might have supplied
some parts of the countenance; cunning Friar Tuck the remainder.&nbsp;
Nothing but the viscount&rsquo;s constant habit of going to church every
Sunday morning when at his country residence kept unholiness out of
his features, for though he lived theologically enough on the Sabbath,
as it became a man in his position to do, he was strikingly mundane
all the rest of the week, always preferring the devil to God in his
oaths.&nbsp; And nothing but antecedent good-humour prevented the short
fits of crossness incident to his passing infirmities from becoming
established.&nbsp; His look was exceptionally jovial now, and the corners
of his mouth twitched as the telegraph-needles of a hundred little erotic
messages from his heart to his brain.&nbsp; Anybody could see that he
was a merry man still, who loved good company, warming drinks, nymph-like
shapes, and pretty words, in spite of the disagreeable suggestions he
received from the pupils of his eyes, and the joints of his lively limbs,
that imps of mischief were busy sapping and mining in those regions,
with the view of tumbling him into a certain cool cellar under the church
aisle.</p>
<p>In general, if a lover can find any ground at all for serenity in
the tide of an elderly rival&rsquo;s success, he finds it in the fact
itself of that ancientness.&nbsp; The other side seems less a rival
than a makeshift.&nbsp; But Christopher no longer felt this, and the
significant signs before his eyes of the imminence of Ethelberta&rsquo;s
union with this old hero filled him with restless dread.&nbsp; True,
the gentleman, as he appeared illuminated by the jeweller&rsquo;s gas-jets,
seemed more likely to injure Ethelberta by indulgence than by severity,
while her beauty lasted; but there was a nameless something in him less
tolerable than this.</p>
<p>The purchaser having completed his dealings with the goldsmith, was
conducted to the door by the master of the shop, and into the carriage,
which was at once driven off up the street.</p>
<p>Christopher now much desired to know the name of the man whom a nice
chain of circumstantial evidence taught him to regard as the happy winner
where scores had lost.&nbsp; He was grieved that Ethelberta&rsquo;s
confessed reserve should have extended so far as to limit her to mere
indefinite hints of marriage when they were talking almost on the brink
of the wedding-day.&nbsp; That the ceremony was to be a private one&mdash;which
it probably would be because of the disparity of ages&mdash;did not
in his opinion justify her secrecy.&nbsp; He had shown himself capable
of a transmutation as valuable as it is rare in men, the change from
pestering lover to staunch friend, and this was all he had got for it.&nbsp;
But even an old lover sunk to an indifferentist might have been tempted
to spend an unoccupied half-hour in discovering particulars now, and
Christopher had not lapsed nearly so far as to absolute unconcern.</p>
<p>That evening, however, nothing came in his way to enlighten him.&nbsp;
But the next day, when skirting the Close on his ordinary duties, he
saw the same carriage standing at a distance, and paused to behold the
same old gentleman come from a well-known office and re-enter the vehicle&mdash;Lord
Mountclere, in fact, in earnest pursuit of the business of yesternight,
having just pocketed a document in which romance, rashness, law, and
gospel are so happily made to work together that it may safely be regarded
as the neatest compromise which has ever been invented since Adam sinned.</p>
<p>This time Julian perceived that the brougham was one belonging to
the White Hart Hotel, which Lord Mountclere was using partly from the
necessities of these hasty proceedings, and also because, by so doing,
he escaped the notice that might have been bestowed upon his own equipage,
or men-servants, the Mountclere hammer-cloths being known in Melchester.&nbsp;
Christopher now walked towards the hotel, leisurely, yet with anxiety.&nbsp;
He inquired of a porter what people were staying there that day, and
was informed that they had only one person in the house, Lord Mountclere,
whom sudden and unexpected business had detained in Melchester since
the previous day.</p>
<p>Christopher lingered to hear no more.&nbsp; He retraced the street
much more quickly than he had come; and he only said, &lsquo;Lord Mountclere&mdash;it
must never be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the house, Faith perceived that he was greatly
agitated.&nbsp; He at once told her of his discovery, and she exclaimed,
&lsquo;What a brilliant match!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Faith,&rsquo; said Christopher, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp;
You are far from knowing.&nbsp; It is as gloomy as midnight.&nbsp; Good
God, can it be possible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith blinked in alarm, without speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you never hear anything of Lord Mountclere when we lived
at Sandbourne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew the name&mdash;no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;of course you did not.&nbsp; Well, though I never
saw his face, to my knowledge, till a short time ago, I know enough
to say that, if earnest representations can prevent it, this marriage
shall not be.&nbsp; Father knew him, or about him, very well; and he
once told me&mdash;what I cannot tell you.&nbsp; Fancy, I have seen
him three times&mdash;yesterday, last night, and this morning&mdash;besides
helping him on the road some weeks ago, and never once considered that
he might be Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; He is here almost in disguise, one
may say; neither man nor horse is with him; and his object accounts
for his privacy.&nbsp; I see how it is&mdash;she is doing this to benefit
her brothers and sisters, if possible; but she ought to know that if
she is miserable they will never be happy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the nature
of women&mdash;they take the form for the essence, and that&rsquo;s
what she is doing now.&nbsp; I should think her guardian angel must
have quitted her when she agreed to a marriage which may tear her heart
out like a claw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are too warm about it, Kit&mdash;it cannot be so bad as
that.&nbsp; It is not the thing, but the sensitiveness to the thing,
which is the true measure of its pain.&nbsp; Perhaps what seems so bad
to you falls lightly on her mind.&nbsp; A campaigner in a heavy rain
is not more uncomfortable than we are in a slight draught; and Ethelberta,
fortified by her sapphires and gold cups and wax candles, will not mind
facts which look like spectres to us outside.&nbsp; A title will turn
troubles into romances, and she will shine as an interesting viscountess
in spite of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The discussion with Faith was not continued, Christopher stopping
the argument by saying that he had a good mind to go off at once to
Knollsea, and show her her danger.&nbsp; But till the next morning Ethelberta
was certainly safe; no marriage was possible anywhere before then.&nbsp;
He passed the afternoon in a state of great indecision, constantly reiterating,
&lsquo;I will go!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>41. WORKSHOPS&mdash;AN INN&mdash;THE STREET</h2>
<p>On an extensive plot of ground, lying somewhere between the Thames
and the Kensington squares, stood the premises of Messrs. Nockett and
Perch, builders and contractors.&nbsp; The yard with its workshops formed
part of one of those frontier lines between mangy business and garnished
domesticity that occur in what are called improving neighbourhoods.&nbsp;
We are accustomed to regard increase as the chief feature in a great
city&rsquo;s progress, its well-known signs greeting our eyes on every
outskirt.&nbsp; Slush-ponds may be seen turning into basement-kitchens;
a broad causeway of shattered earthenware smothers plots of budding
gooseberry-bushes and vegetable trenches, foundations following so closely
upon gardens that the householder may be expected to find cadaverous
sprouts from overlooked potatoes rising through the chinks of his cellar
floor.&nbsp; But the other great process, that of internal transmutation,
is not less curious than this encroachment of grey upon green.&nbsp;
Its first erections are often only the milk-teeth of a suburb, and as
the district rises in dignity they are dislodged by those which are
to endure.&nbsp; Slightness becomes supplanted by comparative solidity,
commonness by novelty, lowness and irregularity by symmetry and height.</p>
<p>An observer of the precinct which has been named as an instance in
point might have stood under a lamp-post and heard simultaneously the
peal of the visitor&rsquo;s bell from the new terrace on the right hand,
and the stroke of tools from the musty workshops on the left.&nbsp;
Waggons laden with deals came up on this side, and landaus came down
on the other&mdash;the former to lumber heavily through the old-established
contractors&rsquo; gates, the latter to sweep fashionably into the square.</p>
<p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock on the day following Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
exhibition of himself to Christopher in the jeweller&rsquo;s shop at
Melchester, and almost at the identical time when the viscount was seen
to come from the office for marriage-licences in the same place, a carriage
drove nearly up to the gates of Messrs. Nockett and Co.&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp;
A gentleman stepped out and looked around.&nbsp; He was a man whose
years would have been pronounced as five-and-forty by the friendly,
fifty by the candid, fifty-two or three by the grim.&nbsp; He was as
handsome a study in grey as could be seen in town, there being far more
of the raven&rsquo;s plumage than of the gull&rsquo;s in the mixture
as yet; and he had a glance of that practised sort which can measure
people, weigh them, repress them, encourage them to sprout and blossom
as a March sun encourages crocuses, ask them questions, give them answers&mdash;in
short, a glance that could do as many things as an American cooking-stove
or a multum-in-parvo pocket-knife.&nbsp; But, as with most men of the
world, this was mere mechanism: his actual emotions were kept so far
within his person that they were rarely heard or seen near his features.</p>
<p>On reading the builders&rsquo; names over the gateway he entered
the yard, and asked at the office if Solomon Chickerel was engaged on
the premises.&nbsp; The clerk was going to be very attentive, but finding
the visitor had come only to speak to a workman, his tense attitude
slackened a little, and he merely signified the foot of a Flemish ladder
on the other side of the yard, saying, &lsquo;You will find him, sir,
up there in the joiner&rsquo;s shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the man in the black coat reached the top he found himself at
the end of a long apartment as large as a chapel and as low as a malt-room,
across which ran parallel carpenters&rsquo; benches to the number of
twenty or more, a gangway being left at the side for access throughout.&nbsp;
Behind every bench there stood a man or two, planing, fitting, or chiselling,
as the case might be.&nbsp; The visitor paused for a moment, as if waiting
for some cessation of their violent motions and uproar till he could
make his errand known.&nbsp; He waited ten seconds, he waited twenty;
but, beyond that a quick look had been thrown upon him by every pair
of eyes, the muscular performances were in no way interrupted: every
one seemed oblivious of his presence, and absolutely regardless of his
wish.&nbsp; In truth, the texture of that salmon-coloured skin could
be seen to be aristocratic without a microscope, and the exceptious
artizan has an offhand way when contrasts are made painfully strong
by an idler of this kind coming, gloved and brushed, into the very den
where he is sweating and muddling in his shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>The gentleman from the carriage then proceeded down the workshop,
wading up to his knees in a sea of shavings, and bruising his ankles
against corners of board and sawn-off blocks, that lay hidden like reefs
beneath.&nbsp; At the ninth bench he made another venture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sol Chickerel?&rsquo; said the man addressed, as he touched
his plane-iron upon the oilstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s one of them
just behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn it all, can&rsquo;t one of you show me?&rsquo; the visitor
angrily observed, for he had been used to more attention than this.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here, point him out.&rsquo;&nbsp; He handed the man a shilling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No trouble to do that,&rsquo; said the workman; and he turned
and signified Sol by a nod without moving from his place.</p>
<p>The stranger entered Sol&rsquo;s division, and, nailing him with
his eye, said at once: &lsquo;I want to speak a few words with you in
private.&nbsp; Is not a Mrs. Petherwin your sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol started suspiciously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has anything happened to her?&rsquo;
he at length said hurriedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; It is on a business matter that I have called.&nbsp;
You need not mind owning the relationship to me&mdash;the secret will
be kept.&nbsp; I am the brother of one whom you may have heard of from
her&mdash;Lord Mountclere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not.&nbsp; But if you will wait a minute, sir&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He went to a little glazed box at the end of the shop, where the foreman
was sitting, and, after speaking a few words to this person, Sol led
Mountclere to the door, and down the ladder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose we cannot very well talk here, after all?&rsquo;
said the gentleman, when they reached the yard, and found several men
moving about therein.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps we had better go to some room&mdash;the nearest inn
will answer the purpose, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Green Bushes&rdquo; over the way.&nbsp;
They have a very nice private room upstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that will do.&rsquo;&nbsp; And passing out of the yard,
the man with the glance entered the inn with Sol, where they were shown
to the parlour as requested.</p>
<p>While the waiter was gone for some wine, which Mountclere ordered,
the more ingenuous of the two resumed the conversation by saying, awkwardly:
&lsquo;Yes, Mrs. Petherwin is my sister, as you supposed, sir; but on
her account I do not let it be known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I came
to see you in order to speak of a matter which I thought you might know
more about than I do, for it has taken me quite by surprise.&nbsp; My
brother, Lord Mountclere, is, it seems, to be privately married to Mrs.
Petherwin to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that really the fact?&rsquo; said Sol, becoming quite shaken.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had no thought that such a thing could be possible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is imminent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father has told me that she has lately got to know some nobleman;
but I never supposed there could be any meaning in that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were altogether wrong,&rsquo; said Mountclere, leaning
back in his chair and looking at Sol steadily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you feel
it to be a matter upon which you will congratulate her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very different thing!&rsquo; said Sol vehemently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though he is your brother, sir, I must say this, that I would
rather she married the poorest man I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From what my father has told me of him, he is not&mdash;a
more desirable brother-in-law to me than I shall be in all likelihood
to him.&nbsp; What business has a man of that character to marry Berta,
I should like to ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rsquo; returned Mountclere, revealing
his satisfaction at Sol&rsquo;s estimate of his noble brother: it showed
that he had calculated well in coming here.&nbsp; &lsquo;My brother
is getting old, and he has lived strangely: your sister is a highly
respectable young lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he is not respectable, you mean?&nbsp; I know he is not.&nbsp;
I worked near Enckworth once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say that,&rsquo; returned Mountclere.&nbsp; Possibly
a certain fraternal feeling repressed a direct assent: and yet this
was the only representation which could be expected to prejudice the
young man against the wedding, if he were such an one as the visitor
supposed Sol to be&mdash;a man vulgar in sentiment and ambition, but
pure in his anxiety for his sister&rsquo;s happiness.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
any rate, we are agreed in thinking that this would be an unfortunate
marriage for both,&rsquo; added Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About both I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It may be a good thing
for him.&nbsp; When do you say it is to be, sir&mdash;to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rsquo; said Sol, walking up
and down.&nbsp; &lsquo;If half what I have heard is true, I would lose
a winter&rsquo;s work to prevent her marrying him.&nbsp; What does she
want to go mixing in with people who despise her for?&nbsp; Now look
here, Mr. Mountclere, since you have been and called me out to talk
this over, it is only fair that you should tell me the exact truth about
your brother.&nbsp; Is it a lie, or is it true, that he is not fit to
be the husband of a decent woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a curious inquiry,&rsquo; said Mountclere, whose manner
and aspect, neutral as a winter landscape, had little in common with
Sol&rsquo;s warm and unrestrained bearing.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are reasons
why I think your sister will not be happy with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is true what they say,&rsquo; said Sol, bringing down
his fist upon the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know your meaning well enough.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s to be done?&nbsp; If I could only see her this minute,
she might be kept out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think your presence would influence your sister&mdash;if
you could see her before the wedding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it would.&nbsp; But who&rsquo;s to get at her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going, so you had better come on with me&mdash;unless
it would be best for your father to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it might,&rsquo; said the bewildered Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
he will not be able to get away; and it&rsquo;s no use for Dan to go.&nbsp;
If anybody goes I must!&nbsp; If she has made up her mind nothing can
be done by writing to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I leave at once to see Lord Mountclere,&rsquo; the other continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I feel that as my brother is evidently ignorant of the position
of Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s family and connections, it is only fair in
me, as his nearest relative, to make them clear to him before it is
too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that if he knew her friends were working-people he
would not think of her as a wife?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a reasonable thought.&nbsp;
But make your mind easy: she has told him.&nbsp; I make a great mistake
if she has for a moment thought of concealing that from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She may not have deliberately done so.&nbsp; But&mdash;and
I say this with no ill-feeling&mdash;it is a matter known to few, and
she may have taken no steps to undeceive him.&nbsp; I hope to bring
him to see the matter clearly.&nbsp; Unfortunately the thing has been
so secret and hurried that there is barely time.&nbsp; I knew nothing
until this morning&mdash;never dreamt of such a preposterous occurrence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Preposterous!&nbsp; If it should come to pass, she would play
her part as his lady as well as any other woman, and better.&nbsp; I
wish there was no more reason for fear on my side than there is on yours!&nbsp;
Things have come to a sore head when she is not considered lady enough
for such as he.&nbsp; But perhaps your meaning is, that if your brother
were to have a son, you would lose your heir-presumptive title to the
cor&rsquo;net of Mountclere?&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twould be rather hard
for ye, now I come to think o&rsquo;t&mdash;upon my life, &rsquo;twould.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The suggestion is as delicate as the --- atmosphere of this
vile room.&nbsp; But let your ignorance be your excuse, my man.&nbsp;
It is hardly worth while for us to quarrel when we both have the same
object in view: do you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; When do you
start, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must leave almost at once,&rsquo; said Mountclere, looking
at his watch.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we cannot catch the two o&rsquo;clock
train, there is no getting there to-night&mdash;and to-morrow we could
not possibly arrive before one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish there was time for me to go and tidy myself a bit,&rsquo;
said Sol, anxiously looking down at his working clothes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
suppose you would not like me to go with you like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confound the clothes!&nbsp; If you cannot start in five minutes,
we shall not be able to go at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then&mdash;wait while I run across to the shop,
then I am ready.&nbsp; How do we get to the station?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My carriage is at the corner waiting.&nbsp; When you come
out I will meet you at the gates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol then hurried downstairs, and a minute or two later Mr. Mountclere
followed, looking like a man bent on policy at any price.&nbsp; The
carriage was brought round by the time that Sol reappeared from the
yard.&nbsp; He entered and sat down beside Mountclere, not without a
sense that he was spoiling good upholstery; the coachman then allowed
the lash of his whip to alight with the force of a small fly upon the
horses, which set them up in an angry trot.&nbsp; Sol rolled on beside
his new acquaintance with the shamefaced look of a man going to prison
in a van, for pedestrians occasionally gazed at him, full of what seemed
to himself to be ironical surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I ought to have changed my clothes after all,&rsquo;
he said, writhing under a perception of the contrast between them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not knowing anything about this, I ain&rsquo;t a bit prepared.&nbsp;
If I had got even my second-best hat, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes no difference,&rsquo; said Mountclere inanimately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or I might have brought my portmantle, with some things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It really is not important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the station they found there were yet a few minutes to
spare, which Sol made use of in writing a note to his father, to explain
what had occurred.</p>
<h2>42. THE DONCASTLES&rsquo; RESIDENCE, AND OUTSIDE THE SAME</h2>
<p>Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s dressing-bell had rung, but Menlove, the lady&rsquo;s
maid, having at the same time received a letter by the evening post,
paused to read it before replying to the summons:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;ENCKWORTH COURT, Wednesday.</p>
<p>DARLING LOUISA,&mdash;I can assure you that I am no more likely than
yourself to form another attachment, as you will perceive by what follows.&nbsp;
Before we left town I thought that to be able to see you occasionally
was sufficient for happiness, but down in this lonely place the case
is different.&nbsp; In short, my dear, I ask you to consent to a union
with me as soon as you possibly can.&nbsp; Your prettiness has won my
eyes and lips completely, sweet, and I lie awake at night to think of
the golden curls you allowed to escape from their confinement on those
nice times of private clothes, when we walked in the park and slipped
the bonds of service, which you were never born to any more than I.
. . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had not my own feelings been so strong, I should have told
you at the first dash of my pen that what I expected is coming to pass
at last&mdash;the old dog is going to be privately married to Mrs. P.&nbsp;
Yes, indeed, and the wedding is coming off to-morrow, secret as the
grave.&nbsp; All her friends will doubtless leave service on account
of it.&nbsp; What he does now makes little difference to me, of course,
as I had already given warning, but I shall stick to him like a Briton
in spite of it.&nbsp; He has to-day made me a present, and a further
five pounds for yourself, expecting you to hold your tongue on every
matter connected with Mrs. P.&rsquo;s friends, and to say nothing to
any of them about this marriage until it is over.&nbsp; His lordship
impressed this upon me very strong, and familiar as a brother, and of
course we obey his instructions to the letter; for I need hardly say
that unless he keeps his promise to help me in setting up the shop,
our nuptials cannot be consumed.&nbsp; His help depends upon our obedience,
as you are aware. . . .&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, and much more, was from her very last lover, Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
valet, who had been taken in hand directly she had convinced herself
of Joey&rsquo;s hopeless youthfulness.&nbsp; The missive sent Mrs. Menlove&rsquo;s
spirits soaring like spring larks; she flew upstairs in answer to the
bell with a joyful, triumphant look, which the illuminated figure of
Mrs. Doncastle in her dressing-room could not quite repress.&nbsp; One
could almost forgive Menlove her arts when so modest a result brought
such vast content.</p>
<p>Mrs. Doncastle seemed inclined to make no remark during the dressing,
and at last Menlove could repress herself no longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to name something to you, m&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be wishing to leave soon, if it is convenient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Menlove,&rsquo; answered Mrs. Doncastle, as she
serenely surveyed her right eyebrow in the glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I
to take this as a formal notice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please; but I could stay a week or two beyond the month
if suitable.&nbsp; I am going to be married&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
it is, m&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; I am glad to hear it, though I am sorry to lose you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s valet&mdash;Mr. Tipman&mdash;m&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Menlove went on building up Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s hair awhile in
silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you heard the other news that arrived in town to-day,
m&rsquo;m?&rsquo; she said again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord Mountclere is going
to be married to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow?&nbsp; Are you quite sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, m&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Mr. Tipman has just told me so in
his letter.&nbsp; He is going to be married to Mrs. Petherwin.&nbsp;
It is to be quite a private wedding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Doncastle made no remark, and she remained in the same still
position as before; but a countenance expressing transcendent surprise
was reflected to Menlove by the glass.</p>
<p>At this sight Menlove&rsquo;s tongue so burned to go further, and
unfold the lady&rsquo;s relations with the butler downstairs, that she
would have lost a month&rsquo;s wages to be at liberty to do it.&nbsp;
The disclosure was almost too magnificent to be repressed.&nbsp; To
deny herself so exquisite an indulgence required an effort which nothing
on earth could have sustained save the one thing that did sustain it&mdash;the
knowledge that upon her silence hung the most enormous desideratum in
the world, her own marriage.&nbsp; She said no more, and Mrs. Doncastle
went away.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary family dinner that day, but their nephew Neigh
happened to be present.&nbsp; Just as they were sitting down Mrs. Doncastle
said to her husband: &lsquo;Why have you not told me of the wedding
to-morrow?&mdash;or don&rsquo;t you know anything about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wedding?&rsquo; said Mr. Doncastle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere is to be married to Mrs. Petherwin quite privately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; said some person.</p>
<p>Mr. Doncastle did not speak the words; they were not spoken by Neigh:
they seemed to float over the room and round the walls, as if originating
in some spiritualistic source.&nbsp; Yet Mrs. Doncastle, remembering
the symptoms of attachment between Ethelberta and her nephew which had
appeared during the summer, looked towards Neigh instantly, as if she
thought the words must have come from him after all; but Neigh&rsquo;s
face was perfectly calm; he, together with her husband, was sitting
with his eyes fixed in the direction of the sideboard; and turning to
the same spot she beheld Chickerel standing pale as death, his lips
being parted as if he did not know where he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you speak?&rsquo; said Mrs. Doncastle, looking with astonishment
at the butler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chickerel, what&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;are you ill?&rsquo;
said Mr. Doncastle simultaneously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was it you who said
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did, sir,&rsquo; said Chickerel in a husky voice, scarcely
above a whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could not help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is my daughter, and it shall be known at once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is your daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused a few moments nervously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Petherwin,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Upon this announcement Neigh looked at poor Chickerel as if he saw
through him into the wall.&nbsp; Mrs. Doncastle uttered a faint exclamation
and leant back in her chair: the bare possibility of the truth of Chickerel&rsquo;s
claims to such paternity shook her to pieces when she viewed her intimacies
with Ethelberta during the past season&mdash;the court she had paid
her, the arrangements she had entered into to please her; above all,
the dinner-party which she had contrived and carried out solely to gratify
Lord Mountclere and bring him into personal communication with the general
favourite; thus making herself probably the chief though unconscious
instrument in promoting a match by which her butler was to become father-in-law
to a peer she delighted to honour.&nbsp; The crowd of perceptions almost
took away her life; she closed her eyes in a white shiver.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say that the lady who sat here at dinner at
the same time that Lord Mountclere was present, is your daughter?&rsquo;
asked Doncastle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Chickerel respectfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did she come to be your daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;&nbsp; Well, she is my daughter, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you educate her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not altogether, sir.&nbsp; She was a very clever child.&nbsp;
Lady Petherwin took a deal of trouble about her education.&nbsp; They
were both left widows about the same time: the son died, then the father.&nbsp;
My daughter was only seventeen then.&nbsp; But though she&rsquo;s older
now, her marriage with Lord Mountclere means misery.&nbsp; He ought
to marry another woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very extraordinary,&rsquo; Mr. Doncastle murmured.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you are ill you had better go and rest yourself, Chickerel.&nbsp;
Send in Thomas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chickerel, who seemed to be much disturbed, then very gladly left
the room, and dinner proceeded.&nbsp; But such was the peculiarity of
the case, that, though there was in it neither murder, robbery, illness,
accident, fire, or any other of the tragic and legitimate shakers of
human nerves, two of the three who were gathered there sat through the
meal without the least consciousness of what viands had composed it.&nbsp;
Impressiveness depends as much upon propinquity as upon magnitude; and
to have honoured unawares the daughter of the vilest Antipodean miscreant
and murderer would have been less discomfiting to Mrs. Doncastle than
it was to make the same blunder with the daughter of a respectable servant
who happened to live in her own house.&nbsp; To Neigh the announcement
was as the catastrophe of a story already begun, rather than as an isolated
wonder.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s words had prepared him for something,
though the nature of that thing was unknown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chickerel ought not to have kept us in ignorance of this&mdash;of
course he ought not!&rsquo; said Mrs. Doncastle, as soon as they were
left alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Doncastle, who
took the matter very coolly, as was his custom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she herself should have let it be known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor does that follow.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t tell Mrs. Petherwin
that your grandfather narrowly escaped hanging for shooting his rival
in a duel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not.&nbsp; There was no reason why I should give
extraneous information.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor was there any reason why she should.&nbsp; As for Chickerel,
he doubtless felt how unbecoming it would be to make personal remarks
upon one of your guests&mdash;Ha-ha-ha!&nbsp; Well, well&mdash;Ha-ha-ha-ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know this,&rsquo; said Mrs. Doncastle, in great anger, &lsquo;that
if my father had been in the room, I should not have let the fact pass
unnoticed, and treated him like a stranger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you have had her introduce Chickerel to us all round?&nbsp;
My dear Margaret, it was a complicated position for a woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she ought not to have come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There may be something in that, though she was dining out
at other houses as good as ours.&nbsp; Well, I should have done just
as she did, for the joke of the thing.&nbsp; Ha-ha-ha!&mdash;it is very
good&mdash;very.&nbsp; It was a case in which the appetite for a jest
would overpower the sting of conscience in any well-constituted being&mdash;that,
my dear, I must maintain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say she should not have come!&rsquo; answered Mrs. Doncastle
firmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course I shall dismiss Chickerel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you will do no such thing.&nbsp; I have never had
a butler in the house before who suited me so well.&nbsp; It is a great
credit to the man to have such a daughter, and I am not sure that we
do not derive some lustre of a humble kind from his presence in the
house.&nbsp; But, seriously, I wonder at your short-sightedness, when
you know the troubles we have had through getting new men from nobody
knows where.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh, perceiving that the breeze in the atmosphere might ultimately
intensify to a palpable black squall, seemed to think it would be well
to take leave of his uncle and aunt as soon as he conveniently could;
nevertheless, he was much less discomposed by the situation than by
the active cause which had led to it.&nbsp; When Mrs. Doncastle arose,
her husband said he was going to speak to Chickerel for a minute or
two, and Neigh followed his aunt upstairs.</p>
<p>Presently Doncastle joined them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been talking
to Chickerel,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a very curious affair&mdash;this
marriage of his daughter and Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; The whole situation
is the most astounding I have ever met with.&nbsp; The man is quite
ill about the news.&nbsp; He has shown me a letter which has just reached
him from his son on the same subject.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
brother and this young man have actually gone off together to try to
prevent the wedding, and Chickerel has asked to be allowed to go himself,
if he can get soon enough to the station to catch the night mail.&nbsp;
Of course he may go if he wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a funny thing!&rsquo; said the lady, with a wretchedly
factitious smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;The times have taken a strange turn when
the angry parent of the comedy, who goes post-haste to prevent the undutiful
daughter&rsquo;s rash marriage, is a gentleman from below stairs, and
the unworthy lover a peer of the realm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neigh spoke for almost the first time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame Chickerel in objecting to Lord Mountclere.&nbsp; I should object
to him myself if I had a daughter.&nbsp; I never liked him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Mrs. Doncastle, lifting her eyelids as if
the act were a heavy task.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For reasons which don&rsquo;t generally appear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Doncastle, in a low tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still,
we must not believe all we hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Chickerel going?&rsquo; said Neigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He leaves in five or ten minutes,&rsquo; said Doncastle.</p>
<p>After a few further words Neigh mentioned that he was unable to stay
longer that evening, and left them.&nbsp; When he had reached the outside
of the door he walked a little way up the pavement and back again, as
if reluctant to lose sight of the street, finally standing under a lamp-post
whence he could command a view of Mr. Doncastle&rsquo;s front.&nbsp;
Presently a man came out in a great-coat and with a small bag in his
hand; Neigh at once recognizing the person as Chickerel, went up to
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Doncastle tells me you are going on a sudden journey.&nbsp;
At what time does your train leave?&rsquo; Neigh asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I go by the ten o&rsquo;clock, sir: I hope it is a third-class,&rsquo;
said Chickerel; &lsquo;though I am afraid it may not be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is as much as you will do to get to the station,&rsquo;
said Neigh, turning the face of his watch to the light.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,
come into my cab&mdash;I am driving that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Chickerel.</p>
<p>Neigh called a cab at the first opportunity, and they entered and
drove along together.&nbsp; Neither spoke during the journey.&nbsp;
When they were driving up to the station entrance Neigh looked again
to see the hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not a minute to lose,&rsquo; he said, in repressed
anxiety.&nbsp; &lsquo;And your journey will be expensive: instead of
walking from Anglebury to Knollsea, you had better drive&mdash;above
all, don&rsquo;t lose time.&nbsp; Never mind what class the train is.&nbsp;
Take this from me, since the emergency is great.&rsquo;&nbsp; He handed
something to Chickerel folded up small.</p>
<p>The butler took it without inquiry, and stepped out hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sincerely hope she&mdash;&nbsp; Well, good-night, Chickerel,&rsquo;
continued Neigh, ending his words abruptly.&nbsp; The cab containing
him drove again towards the station-gates, leaving Chickerel standing
on the kerb.</p>
<p>He passed through the booking-office, and looked at the paper Neigh
had put into his hand.&nbsp; It was a five-pound note.</p>
<p>Chickerel mused on the circumstance as he took his ticket and got
into the train.</p>
<h2>43. THE RAILWAY&mdash;THE SEA&mdash;THE SHORE BEYOND</h2>
<p>By this time Sol and the Honourable Edgar Mountclere had gone far
on their journey into Wessex.&nbsp; Enckworth Court, Mountclere&rsquo;s
destination, though several miles from Knollsea, was most easily accessible
by the same route as that to the village, the latter being the place
for which Sol was bound.</p>
<p>From the few words that passed between them on the way, Mountclere
became more stubborn than ever in a belief that this was a carefully
laid trap of the fair Ethelberta&rsquo;s to ensnare his brother without
revealing to him her family ties, which it therefore behoved him to
make clear, with the utmost force of representation, before the fatal
union had been contracted.&nbsp; Being himself the viscount&rsquo;s
only remaining brother and near relative, the disinterestedness of his
motives may be left to imagination; that there was much real excuse
for his conduct must, however, be borne in mind.&nbsp; Whether his attempt
would prevent the union was another question: he believed that, conjoined
with his personal influence over the viscount, and the importation of
Sol as a firebrand to throw between the betrothed pair, it might do
so.</p>
<p>About half-an-hour before sunset the two individuals, linked by their
differences, reached the point of railway at which the branch to Sandbourne
left the main line.&nbsp; They had taken tickets for Sandbourne, intending
to go thence to Knollsea by the steamer that plied between the two places
during the summer months&mdash;making this a short and direct route.&nbsp;
But it occurred to Mountclere on the way that, summer being over, the
steamer might possibly have left off running, the wind might be too
high for a small boat, and no large one might be at hand for hire: therefore
it would be safer to go by train to Anglebury, and the remaining sixteen
miles by driving over the hills, even at a great loss of time.</p>
<p>Accident, however, determined otherwise.&nbsp; They were in the station
at the junction, inquiring of an official if the <i>Speedwell</i> had
ceased to sail, when a countryman who had just come up from Sandbourne
stated that, though the <i>Speedwell</i> had left off for the year,
there was that day another steamer at Sandbourne.&nbsp; This steamer
would of necessity return to Knollsea that evening, partly because several
people from that place had been on board, and also because the Knollsea
folk were waiting for groceries and draperies from London: there was
not an ounce of tea or a hundredweight of coal in the village, owing
to the recent winds, which had detained the provision parcels at Sandbourne,
and kept the colliers up-channel until the change of weather this day.&nbsp;
To introduce necessaries by a roundabout land journey was not easy when
they had been ordered by the other and habitual route.&nbsp; The boat
returned at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So on they went to Sandbourne, driving off to the pier directly they
reached that place, for it was getting towards night.&nbsp; The steamer
was there, as the man had told them, much to the relief of Sol, who,
being extremely anxious to enter Knollsea before a late hour, had known
that this was the only way in which it could be done.</p>
<p>Some unforeseen incident delayed the boat, and they walked up and
down the pier to wait.&nbsp; The prospect was gloomy enough.&nbsp; The
wind was north-east; the sea along shore was a chalky-green, though
comparatively calm, this part of the coast forming a shelter from wind
in its present quarter.&nbsp; The clouds had different velocities, and
some of them shone with a coppery glare, produced by rays from the west
which did not enter the inferior atmosphere at all.&nbsp; It was reflected
on the distant waves in patches, with an effect as if the waters were
at those particular spots stained with blood.&nbsp; This departed, and
what daylight was left to the earth came from strange and unusual quarters
of the heavens.&nbsp; The zenith would be bright, as if that were the
place of the sun; then all overhead would close, and a whiteness in
the east would give the appearance of morning; while a bank as thick
as a wall barricaded the west, which looked as if it had no acquaintance
with sunsets, and would blush red no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any other passengers?&rsquo; shouted the master of the steamboat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We must be off: it may be a dirty night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol and Mountclere went on board, and the pier receded in the dusk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we have any difficulty in getting into Knollsea Bay?&rsquo;
said Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not if the wind keeps where it is for another hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fancy it is shifting to the east&rsquo;ard,&rsquo; said
Sol.</p>
<p>The captain looked as if he had thought the same thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I shall be able to get home to-night,&rsquo; said a
Knollsea woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;My little children be left alone.&nbsp;
Your mis&rsquo;ess is in a bad way, too&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she, skipper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve got the doctor from Sandbourne aboard, to
tend her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be sure to put into Knollsea, if you can?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
do what we can.&nbsp; But no one must boast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The skipper&rsquo;s remark was the result of an observation that
the wind had at last flown to the east, the single point of the compass
whence it could affect Knollsea Bay.&nbsp; The result of this change
was soon perceptible.&nbsp; About midway in their transit the land elbowed
out to a bold chalk promontory; beyond this stretched a vertical wall
of the same cliff, in a line parallel with their course.&nbsp; In fair
weather it was possible and customary to steer close along under this
hoary facade for the distance of a mile, there being six fathoms of
water within a few boats&rsquo; lengths of the precipice.&nbsp; But
it was an ugly spot at the best of times, landward no less than seaward,
the cliff rounding off at the top in vegetation, like a forehead with
low-grown hair, no defined edge being provided as a warning to unwary
pedestrians on the downs above.</p>
<p>As the wind sprung up stronger, white clots could be discerned at
the water level of the cliff, rising and falling against the black band
of shaggy weed that formed a sort of skirting to the base of the wall.&nbsp;
They were the first-fruits of the new east blast, which shaved the face
of the cliff like a razor&mdash;gatherings of foam in the shape of heads,
shoulders, and arms of snowy whiteness, apparently struggling to rise
from the deeps, and ever sinking back to their old levels again.&nbsp;
They reminded an observer of a drowning scene in a picture of the Deluge.&nbsp;
At some points the face of rock was hollowed into gaping caverns, and
the water began to thunder into these with a leap that was only topped
by the rebound seaward again.&nbsp; The vessel&rsquo;s head was kept
a little further to sea, but beyond that everything went on as usual.</p>
<p>The precipice was still in view, and before it several huge columns
of rock appeared, detached from the mass behind.&nbsp; Two of these
were particularly noticeable in the grey air&mdash;one vertical, stout
and square; the other slender and tapering.&nbsp; They were individualized
as husband and wife by the coast men.&nbsp; The waves leapt up their
sides like a pack of hounds; this, however, though fearful in its boisterousness,
was nothing to the terrible games that sometimes went on round the knees
of those giants in stone.&nbsp; Yet it was sufficient to cause the course
of the frail steamboat to be altered yet a little more&mdash;from south-west-by-south
to south-by-west&mdash;to give the breakers a still wider berth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish we had gone by land, sir; &rsquo;twould have been surer
play,&rsquo; said Sol to Mountclere, a cat-and-dog friendship having
arisen between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Knollsea is an abominable
place to get into with an east wind blowing, they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another circumstance conspired to make their landing more difficult,
which Mountclere knew nothing of.&nbsp; With the wind easterly, the
highest sea prevailed in Knollsea Bay from the slackening of flood-tide
to the first hour of ebb.&nbsp; At that time the water outside stood
without a current, and ridges and hollows chased each other towards
the beach unchecked.&nbsp; When the tide was setting strong up or down
Channel its flow across the mouth of the bay thrust aside, to some extent,
the landward plunge of the waves.</p>
<p>We glance for a moment at the state of affairs on the land they were
nearing.</p>
<p>This was the time of year to know the truth about the inner nature
and character of Knollsea; for to see Knollsea smiling to the summer
sun was to see a courtier before a king; Knollsea was not to be known
by such simple means.&nbsp; The half-dozen detached villas used as lodging-houses
in the summer, standing aloof from the cots of the permanent race, rose
in the dusk of this gusty evening, empty, silent, damp, and dark as
tombs.&nbsp; The gravel walks leading to them were invaded by leaves
and tufts of grass.&nbsp; As the darkness thickened the wind increased,
and each blast raked the iron railings before the houses till they hummed
as if in a song of derision.&nbsp; Certainly it seemed absurd at this
time of year that human beings should expect comfort in a spot capable
of such moods as these.</p>
<p>However, one of the houses looked cheerful, and that was the dwelling
to which Ethelberta had gone.&nbsp; Its gay external colours might as
well have been black for anything that could be seen of them now, but
an unblinded window revealed inside it a room bright and warm.&nbsp;
It was illuminated by firelight only.&nbsp; Within, Ethelberta appeared
against the curtains, close to the glass.&nbsp; She was watching through
a binocular a faint light which had become visible in the direction
of the bluff far away over the bay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is the <i>Spruce</i> at last, I think,&rsquo; she said
to her sister, who was by the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope they will be
able to land the things I have ordered.&nbsp; They are on board I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wind continued to rise till at length something from the lungs
of the gale alighted like a feather upon the pane, and remained there
sticking.&nbsp; Seeing the substance, Ethelberta opened the window to
secure it.&nbsp; The fire roared and the pictures kicked the walls;
she closed the sash, and brought to the light a crisp fragment of foam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How suddenly the sea must have risen,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>The servant entered the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please, mis&rsquo;ess
says she is afraid you won&rsquo;t have your things to-night, &rsquo;m.&nbsp;
They say the steamer can&rsquo;t land, and mis&rsquo;ess wants to know
if she can do anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of no consequence,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
will come some time, unless they go to the bottom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl left the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall we go down to the shore
and see what the night is like?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
is the last opportunity I shall have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it right for us to go, considering you are to be married
to-morrow?&rsquo; said Picotee, who had small affection for nature in
this mood.</p>
<p>Her sister laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us put on our cloaks&mdash;nobody
will know us.&nbsp; I am sorry to leave this grim and primitive place,
even for Enckworth Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They wrapped themselves up, and descended the hill.</p>
<p>On drawing near the battling line of breakers which marked the meeting
of sea and land they could perceive within the nearly invisible horizon
an equilateral triangle of lights.&nbsp; It was formed of three stars,
a red on the one side, a green on the other, and a white on the summit.&nbsp;
This, composed of mast-head and side lamps, was all that was visible
of the <i>Spruce</i>, which now faced end-on about half-a-mile distant,
and was still nearing the pier.&nbsp; The girls went further, and stood
on the foreshore, listening to the din.&nbsp; Seaward appeared nothing
distinct save a black horizontal band embodying itself out of the grey
water, strengthening its blackness, and enlarging till it looked like
a nearing wall.&nbsp; It was the concave face of a coming wave.&nbsp;
On its summit a white edging arose with the aspect of a lace frill;
it broadened, and fell over the front with a terrible concussion.&nbsp;
Then all before them was a sheet of whiteness, which spread with amazing
rapidity, till they found themselves standing in the midst of it, as
in a field of snow.&nbsp; Both felt an insidious chill encircling their
ankles, and they rapidly ran up the beach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You girls, come away there, or you&rsquo;ll be washed off:
what need have ye for going so near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta recognized the stentorian voice as that of Captain Flower,
who, with a party of boatmen, was discovered to be standing near, under
the shelter of a wall.&nbsp; He did not know them in the gloom, and
they took care that he should not.&nbsp; They retreated further up the
beach, when the hissing fleece of froth slid again down the shingle,
dragging the pebbles under it with a rattle as of a beast gnawing bones.</p>
<p>The spot whereon the men stood was called &lsquo;Down-under-wall;&rsquo;
it was a nook commanding a full view of the bay, and hither the nautical
portion of the village unconsciously gravitated on windy afternoons
and nights, to discuss past disasters in the reticent spirit induced
by a sense that they might at any moment be repeated.&nbsp; The stranger
who should walk the shore on roaring and sobbing November eves when
there was not light sufficient to guide his footsteps, and muse on the
absoluteness of the solitude, would be surprised by a smart &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo;
being returned from this corner in company with the echo of his tread.&nbsp;
In summer the six or eight perennial figures stood on the breezy side
of the wall&mdash;in winter and in rain to leeward; but no weather was
known to dislodge them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no sooner come ashore than the wind began to fly round,&rsquo;
said the previous speaker; &lsquo;and it must have been about the time
they were off Old-Harry Point.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll put back for
certain,&rdquo; I said; and I had no more thought o&rsquo; seeing her
than John&rsquo;s set-net that was carried round the point o&rsquo;
Monday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor feller: his wife being in such a state makes him anxious
to land if &rsquo;a can: that&rsquo;s what &rsquo;tis, plain enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why that?&rsquo; said Flower.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor&rsquo;s aboard, &rsquo;a believe: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have the most understanding man in Sandbourne, cost me little or much,&rdquo;
he said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis all over and she&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; said the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I called half-an-hour afore dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Flower, being an experienced man, knew how the judgment of a ship&rsquo;s
master was liable to be warped by family anxieties, many instances of
the same having occurred in the history of navigation.&nbsp; He felt
uneasy, for he knew the deceit and guile of this bay far better than
did the master of the <i>Spruce</i>, who, till within a few recent months,
had been a stranger to the place.&nbsp; Indeed, it was the bay which
had made Flower what he was, instead of a man in thriving retirement.&nbsp;
The two great ventures of his life had been blown ashore and broken
up within that very semicircle.&nbsp; The sturdy sailor now stood with
his eyes fixed on the triangle of lights which showed that the steamer
had not relinquished her intention of bringing up inside the pier if
possible; his right hand was in his pocket, where it played with a large
key which lay there.&nbsp; It was the key of the lifeboat shed, and
Flower was coxswain.&nbsp; His musing was on the possibility of a use
for it this night.</p>
<p>It appeared that the captain of the <i>Spruce</i> was aiming to pass
in under the lee of the pier; but a strong current of four or five knots
was running between the piles, drifting the steamer away at every attempt
as soon as she slowed.&nbsp; To come in on the other side was dangerous,
the hull of the vessel being likely to crash against and overthrow the
fragile erection, with damage to herself also.&nbsp; Flower, who had
disappeared for a few minutes, now came back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just possible I can make &rsquo;em hear with the trumpet,
now they be to leeward,&rsquo; he said, and proceeded with two or three
others to grope his way out upon the pier, which consisted simply of
a row of rotten piles covered with rotten planking, no balustrade of
any kind existing to keep the unwary from tumbling off.&nbsp; At the
water level the piles were eaten away by the action of the sea to about
the size of a man&rsquo;s wrist, and at every fresh influx the whole
structure trembled like a spider&rsquo;s web.&nbsp; In this lay the
danger of making fast, for a strong pull from a headfast rope might
drag the erection completely over.&nbsp; Flower arrived at the end,
where a lantern hung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Spruce</i> ahoy!&rsquo; he blared through the speaking
trumpet two or three times.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a reply of some sort from the steamer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tuesday&rsquo;s gale hev loosened the pier, Cap&rsquo;n Ounce;
the bollards be too weak to make fast to: must land in boats if ye will
land, but dangerous; yer wife is out of danger, and &rsquo;tis a boy-y-y-y!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta and Picotee were at this time standing on the beach a
hundred and fifty yards off.&nbsp; Whether or not the master of the
steamer received the information volunteered by Flower, the two girls
saw the triangle of lamps get narrow at its base, reduce themselves
to two in a vertical line, then to one, then to darkness.&nbsp; The
<i>Spruce</i> had turned her head from Knollsea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have gone back, and I shall not have my wedding things
after all!&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I must do without
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, &rsquo;twas best to play sure,&rsquo; said Flower
to his comrades, in a tone of complacency.&nbsp; &lsquo;They might have
been able to do it, but &rsquo;twas risky.&nbsp; The shop-folk be out
of stock, I hear, and the visiting lady up the hill is terribly in want
of clothes, so &rsquo;tis said.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Ounce
ought to have put back afore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the lantern which hung at the end of the jetty was taken down,
and the darkness enfolded all around from view.&nbsp; The bay became
nothing but a voice, the foam an occasional touch upon the face, the
<i>Spruce</i> an imagination, the pier a memory.&nbsp; Everything lessened
upon the senses but one; that was the wind.&nbsp; It mauled their persons
like a hand, and caused every scrap of their raiment to tug westward.&nbsp;
To stand with the face to sea brought semi-suffocation, from the intense
pressure of air.</p>
<p>The boatmen retired to their position under the wall, to lounge again
in silence.&nbsp; Conversation was not considered necessary: their sense
of each other&rsquo;s presence formed a kind of conversation.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Picotee and Ethelberta went up the hill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If your wedding were going to be a public one, what a misfortune
this delay of the packages would be,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the elder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the bracelet the prettiest of all the presents he
brought to-day&mdash;do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the most valuable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere is very kind, is he not?&nbsp; I like him
a great deal better than I did&mdash;do you, Berta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very much better,&rsquo; said Ethelberta, warming a little.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If he were not so suspicious at odd moments I should like him
exceedingly.&nbsp; But I must cure him of that by a regular course of
treatment, and then he&rsquo;ll be very nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For an old man.&nbsp; He likes you better than any young man
would take the trouble to do.&nbsp; I wish somebody else were old too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will be some day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind: time will straighten many crooked things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think Lord Mountclere has reached home by this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so: though I believe he had to call at the
parsonage before leaving Knollsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had he?&nbsp; What for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course somebody must&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; Do you think anybody in Knollsea knows it is
going to be except us and the parson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose the clerk knows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if a lord has ever been married so privately before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frequently: when he marries far beneath him, as in this case.&nbsp;
But even if I could have had it, I should not have liked a showy wedding.&nbsp;
I have had no experience as a bride except in the private form of the
ceremony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta, I am sometimes uneasy about you even now and I want
to ask you one thing, if I may.&nbsp; Are you doing this for my sake?&nbsp;
Would you have married Mr. Julian if it had not been for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is difficult to say exactly.&nbsp; It is possible that
if I had had no relations at all, I might have married him.&nbsp; And
I might not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case you will live with me at Enckworth.&nbsp; However,
we will leave such details till the ground-work is confirmed.&nbsp;
When we get indoors will you see if the boxes have been properly corded,
and are quite ready to be sent for?&nbsp; Then come in and sit by the
fire, and I&rsquo;ll sing some songs to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sad ones, you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, they shall not be sad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps they may be the last you will ever sing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They may be.&nbsp; Such a thing has occurred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we will not think so.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll suppose you are
to sing many to me yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s good sense in that, Picotee.&nbsp;
In a world where the blind only are cheerful we should all do well to
put out our eyes.&nbsp; There, I did not mean to get into this state:
forgive me, Picotee.&nbsp; It is because I have had a thought&mdash;why
I cannot tell&mdash;that as much as this man brings to me in rank and
gifts he may take out of me in tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there&rsquo;s no reason in it&mdash;not any; for not in
a single matter does what has been supply us with any certain ground
for knowing what will be in the world.&nbsp; I have seen marriages where
happiness might have been said to be ensured, and they have been all
sadness afterwards; and I have seen those in which the prospect was
black as night, and they have led on to a time of sweetness and comfort.&nbsp;
And I have seen marriages neither joyful nor sorry, that have become
either as accident forced them to become, the persons having no voice
in it at all.&nbsp; Well, then, why should I be afraid to make a plunge
when chance is as trustworthy as calculation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t like him well enough, don&rsquo;t have
him, Berta.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s time enough to put it off even now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; I would not upset a well-considered course on
the haste of an impulse.&nbsp; Our will should withstand our misgivings.&nbsp;
Now let us see if all has been packed, and then we&rsquo;ll sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That evening, while the wind was wheeling round and round the dwelling,
and the calm eye of the lighthouse afar was the single speck perceptible
of the outside world from the door of Ethelberta&rsquo;s temporary home,
the music of songs mingled with the stroke of the wind across the iron
railings, and was swept on in the general tide of the gale, and the
noise of the rolling sea, till not the echo of a tone remained.</p>
<p>An hour before this singing, an old gentleman might have been seen
to alight from a little one-horse brougham, and enter the door of Knollsea
parsonage.&nbsp; He was bent upon obtaining an entrance to the vicar&rsquo;s
study without giving his name.</p>
<p>But it happened that the vicar&rsquo;s wife was sitting in the front
room, making a pillow-case for the children&rsquo;s bed out of an old
surplice which had been excommunicated the previous Easter; she heard
the newcomer&rsquo;s voice through the partition, started, and went
quickly to her husband, who was where he ought to have been, in his
study.&nbsp; At her entry he looked up with an abstracted gaze, having
been lost in meditation over a little schooner which he was attempting
to rig for their youngest boy.&nbsp; At a word from his wife on the
suspected name of the visitor, he resumed his earlier occupation of
inserting a few strong sentences, full of the observation of maturer
life, between the lines of a sermon written during his first years of
ordination, in order to make it available for the coming Sunday.&nbsp;
His wife then vanished with the little ship in her hand, and the visitor
appeared.&nbsp; A talk went on in low tones.</p>
<p>After a ten minutes&rsquo; stay he departed as secretly as he had
come.&nbsp; His errand was the cause of much whispered discussion between
the vicar and his wife during the evening, but nothing was said concerning
it to the outside world.</p>
<h2>44. SANDBOURNE&mdash;A LONELY HEATH&mdash;THE &lsquo;RED LION&rsquo;&mdash;THE
HIGHWAY</h2>
<p>It was half-past eleven before the <i>Spruce</i>, with Mountclere
and Sol Chickerel on board, had steamed back again to Sandbourne.&nbsp;
The direction and increase of the wind had made it necessary to keep
the vessel still further to sea on their return than in going, that
they might clear without risk the windy, sousing, thwacking, basting,
scourging Jack Ketch of a corner called Old-Harry Point, which lay about
halfway along their track, and stood, with its detached posts and stumps
of white rock, like a skeleton&rsquo;s lower jaw, grinning at British
navigation.&nbsp; Here strong currents and cross currents were beginning
to interweave their scrolls and meshes, the water rising behind them
in tumultuous heaps, and slamming against the fronts and angles of cliff,
whence it flew into the air like clouds of flour.&nbsp; Who could now
believe that this roaring abode of chaos smiled in the sun as gently
as an infant during the summer days not long gone by, every pinnacle,
crag, and cave returning a doubled image across the glassy sea?</p>
<p>They were now again at Sandbourne, a point in their journey reached
more than four hours ago.&nbsp; It became necessary to consider anew
how to accomplish the difficult remainder.&nbsp; The wind was not blowing
much beyond what seamen call half a gale, but there had been enough
unpleasantness afloat to make landsmen glad to get ashore, and this
dissipated in a slight measure their vexation at having failed in their
purpose.&nbsp; Still, Mountclere loudly cursed their confidence in that
treacherously short route, and Sol abused the unknown Sandbourne man
who had brought the news of the steamer&rsquo;s arrival to them at the
junction.&nbsp; The only course left open to them now, short of giving
up the undertaking, was to go by the road along the shore, which, curving
round the various little creeks and inland seas between their present
position and Knollsea, was of no less length than thirty miles.&nbsp;
There was no train back to the junction till the next morning, and Sol&rsquo;s
proposition that they should drive thither in hope of meeting the mail-train,
was overruled by Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will have nothing more to do with chance,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We may miss the train, and then we shall have gone out of the
way for nothing.&nbsp; More than that, the down mail does not stop till
it gets several miles beyond the nearest station for Knollsea; so it
is hopeless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there had only been a telegraph to the confounded place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Telegraph&mdash;we might as well telegraph to the devil as
to an old booby and a damned scheming young widow.&nbsp; I very much
question if we shall do anything in the matter, even if we get there.&nbsp;
But I suppose we had better go on now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can do as you like.&nbsp; I shall go on, if I have to
walk every step o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not necessary.&nbsp; I think the best posting-house
at this end of the town is Tempett&rsquo;s&mdash;we must knock them
up at once.&nbsp; Which will you do&mdash;attempt supper here, or break
the back of our journey first, and get on to Anglebury?&nbsp; We may
rest an hour or two there, unless you feel really in want of a meal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave eating to merrier men, who have
no sister in the hands of a cursed old Vandal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
go on at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An additional half-hour elapsed before they were fairly started,
the lateness and abruptness of their arrival causing delay in getting
a conveyance ready: the tempestuous night had apparently driven the
whole town, gentle and simple, early to their beds.&nbsp; And when at
length the travellers were on their way the aspect of the weather grew
yet more forbidding.&nbsp; The rain came down unmercifully, the booming
wind caught it, bore it across the plain, whizzed it against the carriage
like a sower sowing his seed.&nbsp; It was precisely such weather, and
almost at the same season, as when Picotee traversed the same moor,
stricken with her great disappointment at not meeting Christopher Julian.</p>
<p>Further on for several miles the drive lay through an open heath,
dotted occasionally with fir plantations, the trees of which told the
tale of their species without help from outline or colour; they spoke
in those melancholy moans and sobs which give to their sound a solemn
sadness surpassing even that of the sea.&nbsp; From each carriage-lamp
the long rays stretched like feelers into the air, and somewhat cheered
the way, until the insidious damp that pervaded all things above, around,
and underneath, overpowered one of them, and rendered every attempt
to rekindle it ineffectual.&nbsp; Even had the two men&rsquo;s dislike
to each other&rsquo;s society been less, the general din of the night
would have prevented much talking; as it was, they sat in a rigid reticence
that was almost a third personality.&nbsp; The roads were laid hereabouts
with a light sandy gravel, which, though not clogging, was soft and
friable.&nbsp; It speedily became saturated, and the wheels ground heavily
and deeply into its substance.</p>
<p>At length, after crossing from ten to twelve miles of these eternal
heaths under the eternally drumming storm, they could discern eyelets
of light winking to them in the distance from under a nebulous brow
of pale haze.&nbsp; They were looking on the little town of Havenpool.&nbsp;
Soon after this cross-roads were reached, one of which, at right angles
to their present direction, led down on the left to that place.&nbsp;
Here the man stopped, and informed them that the horses would be able
to go but a mile or two further.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, we must have others that can,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Does our way lie through the town?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir&mdash;unless we go there to change horses, which I
thought to do.&nbsp; The direct road is straight on.&nbsp; Havenpool
lies about three miles down there on the left.&nbsp; But the water is
over the road, and we had better go round.&nbsp; We shall come to no
place for two or three miles, and then only to Flychett.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s Flychett like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A trumpery small bit of a village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, I think we had better push on,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am against running the risk of finding the way flooded about
Havenpool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; returned Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know a wheelwright in Flychett,&rsquo; continued Sol, &lsquo;and
he keeps a beer-house, and owns two horses.&nbsp; We could hire them,
and have a bit of sommat in the shape of victuals, and then get on to
Anglebury.&nbsp; Perhaps the rain may hold up by that time.&nbsp; Anything&rsquo;s
better than going out of our way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And the horses can last out to that place,&rsquo;
said Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Up and on again, my man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On they went towards Flychett.&nbsp; Still the everlasting heath,
the black hills bulging against the sky, the barrows upon their round
summits like warts on a swarthy skin.&nbsp; The storm blew huskily over
bushes of heather and furze that it was unable materially to disturb,
and the travellers proceeded as before.&nbsp; But the horses were now
far from fresh, and the time spent in reaching the next village was
quite half as long as that taken up by the previous heavy portion of
the drive.&nbsp; When they entered Flychett it was about three.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, where&rsquo;s the inn?&rsquo; said Mountclere, yawning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just on the knap,&rsquo; Sol answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
a little small place, and we must do as well as we can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They pulled up before a cottage, upon the whitewashed front of which
could be seen a square board representing the sign.&nbsp; After an infinite
labour of rapping and shouting, a casement opened overhead, and a woman&rsquo;s
voice inquired what was the matter.&nbsp; Sol explained, when she told
them that the horses were away from home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now we must wait till these are rested,&rsquo; growled Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A pretty muddle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be helped,&rsquo; answered Sol; and he asked the
woman to open the door.&nbsp; She replied that her husband was away
with the horses and van, and that they could not come in.</p>
<p>Sol was known to her, and he mentioned his name; but the woman only
began to abuse him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, publican, you&rsquo;d better let us in, or we&rsquo;ll
have the law for&rsquo;t,&rsquo; rejoined Sol, with more spirit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t dare to keep nobility waiting like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobility!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mate hev the title of Honourable, whether or no; so let&rsquo;s
have none of your slack,&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, young chopstick,&rsquo; exclaimed Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Get the door opened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will&mdash;in my own way,&rsquo; said Sol testily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind my trading upon your quality, as &rsquo;tis
a case of necessity.&nbsp; This is a woman nothing will bring to reason
but an appeal to the higher powers.&nbsp; If every man of title was
as useful as you are to-night, sir, I&rsquo;d never call them lumber
again as long as I live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How singular!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s never a bit of rubbish that won&rsquo;t come
in use if you keep it seven years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If my utility depends upon keeping you company, may I go to
h--- for lacking every atom of the virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear, hear!&nbsp; But it hardly is becoming in me to answer
up to a man so much older than I, or I could say more.&nbsp; Suppose
we draw a line here for the present, sir, and get indoors?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do what you will, in Heaven&rsquo;s name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few more words to the woman resulted in her agreeing to admit them
if they would attend to themselves afterwards.&nbsp; This Sol promised,
and the key of the door was let down to them from the bedroom window
by a string.&nbsp; When they had entered, Sol, who knew the house well,
busied himself in lighting a fire, the driver going off with a lantern
to the stable, where he found standing-room for the two horses.&nbsp;
Mountclere walked up and down the kitchen, mumbling words of disgust
at the situation, the few of this kind that he let out being just enough
to show what a fearfully large number he kept in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A-calling up people at this time of morning!&rsquo; the woman
occasionally exclaimed down the stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;But folks show
no mercy upon their flesh and blood&mdash;not one bit or mite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now never be stomachy, my good soul,&rsquo; cried Sol from
the fireplace, where he stood blowing the fire with his breath.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only tell me where the victuals bide, and I&rsquo;ll do all the
cooking.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll pay like princes&mdash;especially my mate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s but little in house,&rsquo; said the sleepy
woman from her bedroom.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s pig&rsquo;s fry,
a side of bacon, a conger eel, and pickled onions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conger eel?&rsquo; said Sol to Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pig&rsquo;s fry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, tell me where the bacon is,&rsquo; shouted Sol
to the woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must find it,&rsquo; came again down the stairs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis somewhere up in chimley, but in which part I can&rsquo;t
mind.&nbsp; Really I don&rsquo;t know whether I be upon my head or my
heels, and my brain is all in a spin, wi&rsquo; being rafted up in such
a larry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bide where you be, there&rsquo;s a dear,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do it all.&nbsp; Just tell us where the tea-caddy
is, and the gridiron, and then you can go to sleep again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman appeared to take his advice, for she gave the information,
and silence soon reigned upstairs.</p>
<p>When one piece of bacon had been with difficulty cooked over the
newly-lit fire, Sol said to Mountclere, with the rasher on his fork:
&lsquo;Now look here, sir, I think while I am making the tea, you ought
to go on griddling some more of these, as you haven&rsquo;t done nothing
at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do the paying. . . .&nbsp; Well, give me the bacon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when you have done yours, I&rsquo;ll cook the man&rsquo;s,
as the poor feller&rsquo;s hungry, I make no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mountclere, fork in hand, then began with his rasher, tossing it
about the gridiron in masterly style, Sol attending to the tea.&nbsp;
He was attracted from this occupation by a brilliant flame up the chimney,
Mountclere exclaiming, &lsquo;Now the cursed thing is on fire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blow it out&mdash;hard&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; Well now,
sir, do you come and begin upon mine, as you must be hungry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
finish the griddling.&nbsp; Ought we to mind the man sitting down in
our company, as there&rsquo;s no other room for him?&nbsp; I hear him
coming in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;not at all.&nbsp; Put him over at that table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll join him.&nbsp; You can sit here by yourself,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The meal was despatched, and the coachman again retired, promising
to have the horses ready in about an hour and a half.&nbsp; Sol and
Mountclere made themselves comfortable upon either side of the fireplace,
since there was no remedy for the delay: after sitting in silence awhile,
they nodded and slept.</p>
<p>How long they would have remained thus, in consequence of their fatigues,
there is no telling, had not the mistress of the cottage descended the
stairs about two hours later, after peeping down upon them at intervals
of five minutes during their sleep, lest they should leave without her
knowledge.&nbsp; It was six o&rsquo;clock, and Sol went out for the
man, whom he found snoring in the hay-loft.&nbsp; There was now real
necessity for haste, and in ten minutes they were again on their way.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Day dawned upon the &lsquo;Red Lion&rsquo; inn at Anglebury with
a timid and watery eye.&nbsp; From the shadowy archway came a shining
lantern, which was seen to be dangling from the hand of a little bow-legged
old man&mdash;the hostler, John.&nbsp; Having reached the front, he
looked around to measure the daylight, opened the lantern, and extinguished
it by a pinch of his fingers.&nbsp; He paused for a moment to have the
customary word or two with his neighbour the milkman, who usually appeared
at this point at this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It sounds like the whistle of the morning train,&rsquo; the
milkman said as he drew near, a scream from the further end of the town
reaching their ears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I hope, now the wind&rsquo;s
in that quarter, we shall ha&rsquo;e a little more fine weather&mdash;hey,
hostler?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What be ye a talking o&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can hear the whistle plain, I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O ay.&nbsp; I suppose you do.&nbsp; But faith, &rsquo;tis
a poor fist I can make at hearing anything.&nbsp; There, I could have
told all the same that the wind was in the east, even if I had not seed
poor Thomas Tribble&rsquo;s smoke blowing across the little orchard.&nbsp;
Joints be a true weathercock enough when past three-score.&nbsp; These
easterly rains, when they do come, which is not often, come wi&rsquo;
might enough to squail a man into his grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we must look for it, hostler. . . .&nbsp; Why, what
mighty ekkypage is this, come to town at such a purblinking time of
day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis what time only can tell&mdash;though &rsquo;twill
not be long first,&rsquo; the hostler replied, as the driver of the
pair of horses and carriage containing Sol and Mountclere slackened
pace, and drew rein before the inn.</p>
<p>Fresh horses were immediately called for, and while they were being
put in the two travellers walked up and down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is now a quarter to seven o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; said Mountclere;
&lsquo;and the question arises, shall I go on to Knollsea, or branch
off at Corvsgate Castle for Enckworth?&nbsp; I think the best plan will
be to drive first to Enckworth, set me down, and then get him to take
you on at once to Knollsea.&nbsp; What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When shall I reach Knollsea by that arrangement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By half-past eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We shall be at Enckworth
before eight, which is excellent time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, sir, I agree to that,&rsquo; said Sol, feeling
that as soon as one of the two birds had been caught, the other could
not mate without their knowledge.</p>
<p>The carriage and horses being again ready, away they drove at once,
both having by this time grown too restless to spend in Anglebury a
minute more than was necessary.</p>
<p>The hostler and his lad had taken the jaded Sandbourne horses to
the stable, rubbed them down, and fed them, when another noise was heard
outside the yard; the omnibus had returned from meeting the train.&nbsp;
Relinquishing the horses to the small stable-lad, the old hostler again
looked out from the arch.</p>
<p>A young man had stepped from the omnibus, and he came forward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want a conveyance of some sort to take me to Knollsea, at once.&nbsp;
Can you get a horse harnessed in five minutes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make shift to do what I can master, not promising
about the minutes.&nbsp; The truest man can say no more.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
ye step into the bar, sir, and give your order?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let
ye know as soon as &rsquo;tis ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher turned into a room smelling strongly of the night before,
and stood by the newly-kindled fire to wait.&nbsp; He had just come
in haste from Melchester.&nbsp; The upshot of his excitement about the
wedding, which, as the possible hour of its solemnization drew near,
had increased till it bore him on like a wind, was this unpremeditated
journey.&nbsp; Lying awake the previous night, the hangings of his bed
pulsing to every beat of his heart, he decided that there was one last
and great service which it behoved him, as an honest man and friend,
to say nothing of lover, to render to Ethelberta at this juncture.&nbsp;
It was to ask her by some means whether or not she had engaged with
open eyes to marry Lord Mountclere; and if not, to give her a word or
two of enlightenment.&nbsp; That done, she might be left to take care
of herself.</p>
<p>His plan was to obtain an interview with Picotee, and learn from
her accurately the state of things.&nbsp; Should he, by any possibility,
be mistaken in his belief as to the contracting parties, a knowledge
of the mistake would be cheaply purchased by the journey.&nbsp; Should
he not, he would send up to Ethelberta the strong note of expostulation
which was already written, and waiting in his pocket.&nbsp; To intrude
upon her at such a time was unseemly; and to despatch a letter by a
messenger before evidence of its necessity had been received was most
undesirable.&nbsp; The whole proceeding at best was clumsy; yet earnestness
is mostly clumsy; and how could he let the event pass without a protest?&nbsp;
Before daylight on that autumn morning he had risen, told Faith of his
intention, and started off.</p>
<p>As soon as the vehicle was ready, Christopher hastened to the door
and stepped up.&nbsp; The little stable-boy led the horse a few paces
on the way before relinquishing his hold; at the same moment a respectably
dressed man on foot, with a small black bag in his hand, came up from
the opposite direction, along the street leading from the railway.&nbsp;
He was a thin, elderly man, with grey hair; that a great anxiety pervaded
him was as plainly visible as were his features.&nbsp; Without entering
the inn, he came up at once to old John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you anything going to Knollsea this morning that I can
get a lift in?&rsquo; said the pedestrian&mdash;no other than Ethelberta&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing empty, that I know of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or carrier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A matter of fifteen shillings, then, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;no doubt.&nbsp; But yond there&rsquo;s a young man
just now starting; he might not take it ill if ye were to ask him for
a seat, and go halves in the hire of the trap.&nbsp; Shall I call out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hostler bawled to the stable-boy, who put the question to Christopher.&nbsp;
There was room for two in the dogcart, and Julian had no objection to
save the shillings of a fellow-traveller who was evidently not rich.&nbsp;
When Chickerel mounted to his seat, Christopher paused to look at him
as we pause in some enactment that seems to have been already before
us in a dream long ago.&nbsp; Ethelberta&rsquo;s face was there, as
the landscape is in the map, the romance in the history, the aim in
the deed: denuded, rayless, and sorry, but discernible.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, this did not occur to Julian.&nbsp; He took
the whip, the boy loosed his hold upon the horse, and they proceeded
on their way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What slap-dash jinks may there be going on at Knollsea, then,
my sonny?&rsquo; said the hostler to the lad, as the dogcart and the
backs of the two men diminished on the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;You be a Knollsea
boy: have anything reached your young ears about what&rsquo;s in the
wind there, David Straw?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nothing: except that &rsquo;tis going to be Christmas
day in five weeks: and then a hide-bound bull is going to be killed
if he don&rsquo;t die afore the time, and gi&rsquo;ed away by my lord
in three-pound junks, as a reward to good people who never curse and
sing bad songs, except when they be drunk; mother says perhaps she will
have some, and &rsquo;tis excellent if well stewed, mother says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very fair chronicle for a boy to give, but not what I asked
for.&nbsp; When you try to answer a old man&rsquo;s question, always
bear in mind what it was that old man asked.&nbsp; A hide-bound bull
is good when well stewed, I make no doubt&mdash;for they who like it;
but that&rsquo;s not it.&nbsp; What I said was, do you know why three
fokes, a rich man, a middling man, and a poor man, should want horses
for Knollsea afore seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning on a blinking
day in Fall, when everything is as wet as a dishclout, whereas that&rsquo;s
more than often happens in fine summer weather?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, John hostler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then go home and tell your mother that ye be no wide-awake
boy, and that old John, who went to school with her father afore she
was born or thought o&rsquo;, says so. . . .&nbsp; Chok&rsquo; it all,
why should I think there&rsquo;s sommat going on at Knollsea?&nbsp;
Honest travelling have been so rascally abused since I was a boy in
pinners, by tribes of nobodies tearing from one end of the country to
t&rsquo;other, to see the sun go down in salt water, or the moon play
jack-lantern behind some rotten tower or other, that, upon my song,
when life and death&rsquo;s in the wind there&rsquo;s no telling the
difference!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like their sixpences ever so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young sonny, don&rsquo;t you answer up to me when you baint
in the story&mdash;stopping my words in that fashion.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
have it, David.&nbsp; Now up in the tallet with ye, there&rsquo;s a
good boy, and down with another lock or two of hay&mdash;as fast as
you can do it for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy vanished under the archway, and the hostler followed at his
heels.&nbsp; Meanwhile the carriage bearing Mr. Mountclere and Sol was
speeding on its way to Enckworth.&nbsp; When they reached the spot at
which the road forked into two, they left the Knollsea route, and keeping
thence under the hills for the distance of five or six miles, drove
into Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s park.&nbsp; In ten minutes the house was
before them, framed in by dripping trees.</p>
<p>Mountclere jumped out, and entered without ceremony.&nbsp; Sol, being
anxious to know if Lord Mountclere was there, ordered the coachman to
wait a few moments.&nbsp; It was now nearly eight o&rsquo;clock, and
the smoke which ascended from the newly-lit fires of the Court painted
soft blue tints upon the brown and golden leaves of lofty boughs adjoining.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Ethelberta!&rsquo; said Sol, as he regarded the fair prospect.</p>
<p>The gravel of the drive had been washed clean and smooth by the night&rsquo;s
rain, but there were fresh wheelmarks other than their own upon the
track.&nbsp; Yet the mansion seemed scarcely awake, and stillness reigned
everywhere around.</p>
<p>Not more than three or four minutes had passed when the door was
opened for Mountclere, and he came hastily from the doorsteps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go on with you,&rsquo; he said, getting into the vehicle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&mdash;to Knollsea?&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, go ahead to
Knollsea!&rsquo; he shouted to the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;To think I should
be fooled like this!&nbsp; I had no idea that he would be leaving so
soon!&nbsp; We might perhaps have been here an hour earlier by hard
striving.&nbsp; But who was to dream that he would arrange to leave
it at such an unearthly time of the morning at this dark season of the
year?&nbsp; Drive&mdash;drive!&rsquo; he called again out of the window,
and the pace was increased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come two or three miles out of my way on account of
you,&rsquo; said Sol sullenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And all this time lost.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t see why you wanted to come here at all.&nbsp; I knew it
would be a waste of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn it all, man,&rsquo; said Mountclere; &lsquo;it is no
use for you to be angry with me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is, for &rsquo;tis you have brought me into this
muddle,&rsquo; said Sol, in no sweeter tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp;
Upon my life I should be inclined to laugh, if I were not so much inclined
to do the other thing, at Berta&rsquo;s trick of trying to make close
family allies of such a cantankerous pair as you and I!&nbsp; So much
of one mind as we be, so alike in our ways of living, so close connected
in our callings and principles, so matched in manners and customs! &rsquo;twould
be a thousand pities to part us&mdash;hey, Mr. Mountclere!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mountclere faintly laughed with the same hideous merriment at the
same idea, and then both remained in a withering silence, meant to express
the utter contempt of each for the other, both in family and in person.&nbsp;
They passed the Lodge, and again swept into the highroad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drive on!&rsquo; said Mountclere, putting his head again out
of the window, and shouting to the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Drive like the
devil!&rsquo; he roared again a few minutes afterwards, in fuming dissatisfaction
with their rate of progress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baint I doing of it?&rsquo; said the driver, turning angrily
round.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to ruin my governor&rsquo;s
horses for strangers who won&rsquo;t pay double for &rsquo;em&mdash;not
I.&nbsp; I am driving as fast as I can.&nbsp; If other folks get in
the way with their traps I suppose I must drive round &rsquo;em, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight crash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; continued the coachman.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
what comes of my turning round!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol looked out on the other side, and found that the forewheel of
their carriage had become locked in the wheel of a dogcart they had
overtaken, the road here being very narrow.&nbsp; Their coachman, who
knew he was to blame for this mishap, felt the advantage of taking time
by the forelock in a case of accusation, and began swearing at his victim
as if he were the sinner.&nbsp; Sol jumped out, and looking up at the
occupants of the other conveyance, saw against the sky the back elevation
of his father and Christopher Julian, sitting upon a little seat which
they overhung, like two big puddings upon a small dish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father&mdash;what, you going?&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
it about Berta that you&rsquo;ve come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I got your letter,&rsquo; said Chickerel, &lsquo;and
I felt I should like to come&mdash;that I ought to come, to save her
from what she&rsquo;ll regret.&nbsp; Luckily, this gentleman, a stranger
to me, has given me a lift from Anglebury, or I must have hired.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He pointed to Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s Mr. Julian!&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are Mrs. Petherwin&rsquo;s father?&mdash;I have travelled
in your company without knowing it!&rsquo; exclaimed Christopher, feeling
and looking both astonished and puzzled.&nbsp; At first, it had appeared
to him that, in direct antagonism to his own purpose, her friends were
favouring Ethelberta&rsquo;s wedding; but it was evidently otherwise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s father,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;Father,
this is Mr. Julian.&nbsp; Mr. Julian, this gentleman here is Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s
brother&mdash;and, to cut the story short, we all wish to stop the wedding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let us get on, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are the lady&rsquo;s father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you had better come into this carriage.&nbsp; We shall
go faster than the dogcart.&nbsp; Now, driver, are the wheels right
again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chickerel hastily entered with Mountclere, Sol joined them, and they
sped on.&nbsp; Christopher drove close in their rear, not quite certain
whether he did well in going further, now that there were plenty of
people to attend to the business, but anxious to see the end.&nbsp;
The other three sat in silence, with their eyes upon their knees, though
the clouds were dispersing, and the morning grew bright.&nbsp; In about
twenty minutes the square unembattled tower of Knollsea Church appeared
below them in the vale, its summit just touching the distant line of
sea upon sky.&nbsp; The element by which they had been victimized on
the previous evening now smiled falsely to the low morning sun.</p>
<p>They descended the road to the village at a little more mannerly
pace than that of the earlier journey, and saw the rays glance upon
the hands of the church clock, which marked five-and-twenty minutes
to nine.</p>
<h2>45. KNOLLSEA&mdash;THE ROAD THENCE&mdash;ENCKWORTH</h2>
<p>All eyes were directed to the church-gate, as the travellers descended
the hill.&nbsp; No wedding carriages were there, no favours, no slatternly
group of women brimming with interest, no aged pauper on two sticks,
who comes because he has nothing else to do till dying time, no nameless
female passing by on the other side with a laugh of indifference, no
ringers taking off their coats as they vanish up a turret, no hobbledehoys
on tiptoe outside the chancel windows&mdash;in short, none whatever
of the customary accessories of a country wedding was anywhere visible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; said Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait till you know he deserves it,&rsquo; said Mountclere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s done yet between them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not likely that anything is done at this time of day.&nbsp;
But I have decided to go to the church first.&nbsp; You will probably
go to your relative&rsquo;s house at once?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol looked to his father for a reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I too shall go to the church first, just to assure myself,&rsquo;
said Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall then go on to Mrs Petherwin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The carriage was stopped at the corner of a steep incline leading
down to the edifice.&nbsp; Mountclere and Chickerel alighted and walked
on towards the gates, Sol remaining in his place.&nbsp; Christopher
was some way off, descending the hill on foot, having halted to leave
his horse and trap at a small inn at the entrance to the village.</p>
<p>When Chickerel and Mountclere reached the churchyard gate they found
it slightly open.&nbsp; The church-door beyond it was also open, but
nobody was near the spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have arrived not a minute too soon, however,&rsquo; said
Mountclere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Preparations have apparently begun.&nbsp; It
was to be an early wedding, no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Entering the building, they looked around; it was quite empty.&nbsp;
Chickerel turned towards the chancel, his eye being attracted by a red
kneeling-cushion, placed at about the middle of the altar-railing, as
if for early use.&nbsp; Mountclere strode to the vestry, somewhat at
a loss how to proceed in his difficult task of unearthing his brother,
obtaining a private interview with him, and then, by the introduction
of Sol and Chickerel, causing a general convulsion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! here&rsquo;s somebody,&rsquo; he said, observing a man
in the vestry.&nbsp; He advanced with the intention of asking where
Lord Mountclere was to be found.&nbsp; Chickerel came forward in the
same direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you the parish clerk?&rsquo; said Mountclere to the man,
who was dressed up in his best clothes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hev the honour of that calling,&rsquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>Two large books were lying before him on the vestry table, one of
them being open.&nbsp; As the clerk spoke he looked slantingly on the
page, as a person might do to discover if some writing were dry.&nbsp;
Mountclere and Chickerel gazed on the same page.&nbsp; The book was
the marriage-register.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late!&rsquo; said Chickerel.</p>
<p>There plainly enough stood the signatures of Lord Mountclere and
Ethelberta.&nbsp; The viscount&rsquo;s was very black, and had not yet
dried.&nbsp; Her strokes were firm, and comparatively thick for a woman&rsquo;s,
though paled by juxtaposition with her husband&rsquo;s muddled characters.&nbsp;
In the space for witnesses&rsquo; names appeared in trembling lines
as fine as silk the autograph of Picotee, the second name being that
of a stranger, probably the clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;we are too late, it seems,&rsquo; said Mountclere
coolly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who could have thought they&rsquo;d marry at eight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chickerel stood like a man baked hard and dry.&nbsp; Further than
his first two words he could say nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must have set about it early, upon my soul,&rsquo; Mountclere
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;When did the wedding take place?&rsquo; he asked
of the clerk sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was over about five minutes before you came in,&rsquo;
replied that luminary pleasantly, as he played at an invisible game
of pitch-and-toss with some half-sovereigns in his pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
received orders to have the church ready at five minutes to eight this
morning, though I knew nothing about such a thing till bedtime last
night.&nbsp; It was very private and plain, not that I should mind another
such a one, sir;&rsquo; and he secretly pitched and tossed again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sol had found himself too restless to sit waiting in the
carriage for more than a minute after the other two had left it.&nbsp;
He stepped out at the same instant that Christopher came past, and together
they too went on to the church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, ought we not to go on at once to Ethelberta&rsquo;s,
instead of waiting?&rsquo; said Sol, on reaching the vestry, still in
ignorance.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas no use in coming here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No use at all,&rsquo; said Chickerel, as if he had straw in
his throat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at this.&nbsp; I would almost sooner have
had it that in leaving this church I came from her grave&mdash;well,
no, perhaps not that, but I fear it is a bad thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol then saw the names in the register, Christopher saw them, and
the man closed the book.&nbsp; Christopher could not well command himself,
and he retired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it.&nbsp; I always said that pride would lead Berta
to marry an unworthy man, and so it has!&rsquo; said Sol bitterly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What shall we do now?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do no such thing, young man,&rsquo; said Mountclere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The best course is to leave matters alone.&nbsp; They are married.&nbsp;
If you are wise, you will try to think the match a good one, and be
content to let her keep her position without inconveniencing her by
your intrusions or complaints.&nbsp; It is possible that the satisfaction
of her ambition will help her to endure any few surprises to her propriety
that may occur.&nbsp; She is a clever young woman, and has played her
cards adroitly.&nbsp; I only hope she may never repent of the game!&nbsp;
A-hem.&nbsp; Good morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying this, Mountclere slightly
bowed to his relations, and marched out of the church with dignity;
but it was told afterwards by the coachman, who had no love for Mountclere,
that when he stepped into the fly, and was as he believed unobserved,
he was quite overcome with fatuous rage, his lips frothing like a mug
of hot ale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an impertinent gentleman &rsquo;tis,&rsquo; said Chickerel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As if we had tried for her to marry his brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He knows better than that,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
he&rsquo;ll never believe that Berta didn&rsquo;t lay a trap for the
old fellow.&nbsp; He thinks at this moment that Lord Mountclere has
never been told of us and our belongings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if she has deceived him in anything,&rsquo; murmured
Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can hardly suppose it.&nbsp; But she is altogether
beyond me.&nbsp; However, if she has misled him on any point she will
suffer for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not fear that, father.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t her way
of working.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t she have known that when a title
is to be had for the asking, the owner must be a shocking one indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The title is well enough.&nbsp; Any poor scrubs in our place
must be fools not to think the match a very rare and astonishing honour,
as far as the position goes.&nbsp; But that my brave girl will be miserable
is a part of the honour I can&rsquo;t stomach so well.&nbsp; If he had
been any other lord in the kingdom, we might have been merry indeed.&nbsp;
I believe he will ruin her happiness&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;not by any
personal snubbing or rough conduct, but by other things, causing her
to be despised; and that is a thing she can&rsquo;t endure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not to be despised without a deal of trouble&mdash;we
must remember that.&nbsp; And if he insults her by introducing new favourites,
as they say he did his first wife, I&rsquo;ll call upon him and ask
his meaning, and take her away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense&mdash;we shall never know what he does, or how she
feels; she will never let out a word.&nbsp; However unhappy she may
be, she will always deny it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the unfortunate part
of such marriages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An old chap like that ought to leave young women alone, damn
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk came nearer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid I cannot allow bad
words to be spoke in this sacred pile,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;As
far as my personal self goes, I should have no objection to your cussing
as much as you like, but as a official of the church my conscience won&rsquo;t
allow it to be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your conscience has allowed something to be done that cussing
and swearing are godly worship to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The prettiest maid is left out of harness, however,&rsquo;
said the clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;The little witness was the chicken to my
taste&mdash;Lord forgive me for saying it, and a man with a wife and
family!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol and his father turned to withdraw, and soon forgot the remark,
but it was frequently recalled by Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think of trying to see Ethelberta before you leave?&rsquo;
said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Mountclere&rsquo;s
advice was good in that.&nbsp; The more we keep out of the way the more
good we are doing her.&nbsp; I shall go back to Anglebury by the carrier,
and get on at once to London.&nbsp; You will go with me, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The carrier does not leave yet for an hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall walk on, and let him overtake me.&nbsp; If possible,
I will get one glimpse of Enckworth Court, Berta&rsquo;s new home; there
may be time, if I start at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will walk with you,&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is room for one with me,&rsquo; said Christopher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall drive back early in the afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will endeavour
to meet you at Corvsgate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was arranged.&nbsp; Chickerel could have wished to search
for Picotee, and learn from her the details of this mysterious matter.&nbsp;
But it was particularly painful to him to make himself busy after the
event; and to appear suddenly and uselessly where he was plainly not
wanted to appear would be an awkwardness which the pleasure of seeing
either daughter could scarcely counterbalance.&nbsp; Hence he had resolved
to return at once to town, and there await the news, together with the
detailed directions as to his own future movements, carefully considered
and laid down, which were sure to be given by the far-seeing Ethelberta.</p>
<p>Sol and his father walked on together, Chickerel to meet the carrier
just beyond Enckworth, Sol to wait for Christopher at Corvsgate.&nbsp;
His wish to see, in company with his father, the outline of the seat
to which Ethelberta had been advanced that day, was the triumph of youthful
curiosity and interest over dogged objection.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s
wish was based on calmer reasons.</p>
<p>Christopher, lone and out of place, remained in the church yet a
little longer.&nbsp; He desultorily walked round.&nbsp; Reaching the
organ chamber, he looked at the instrument, and was surprised to find
behind it a young man.&nbsp; Julian first thought him to be the organist;
on second inspection, however, he proved to be a person Christopher
had met before, under far different circumstances; it was our young
friend Ladywell, looking as sick and sorry as a lily with a slug in
its stalk.</p>
<p>The occasion, the place, and their own condition, made them kin.&nbsp;
Christopher had despised Ladywell, Ladywell had disliked Christopher;
but a third item neutralized the other two&mdash;it was their common
lot.</p>
<p>Christopher just nodded, for they had only met on Ethelberta&rsquo;s
stairs.&nbsp; Ladywell nodded more, and spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;The church
appears to be interesting,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Such a tower is rare in England,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>They then dwelt on other features of the building, thence enlarging
to the village, and then to the rocks and marine scenery, both avoiding
the malady they suffered from&mdash;the marriage of Ethelberta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The village streets are very picturesque, and the cliff scenery
is good of its kind,&rsquo; rejoined Ladywell.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rocks
represent the feminine side of grandeur.&nbsp; Here they are white,
with delicate tops.&nbsp; On the west coast they are higher, black,
and with angular summits.&nbsp; Those represent grandeur in its masculine
aspect.&nbsp; It is merely my own idea, and not very bright, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very ingenious,&rsquo; said Christopher, &lsquo;and
perfectly true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ladywell was pleased.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am here at present making sketches
for my next subject&mdash;a winter sea.&nbsp; Otherwise I should not
have&mdash;happened to be in the church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are acquainted with Mrs. Petherwin&mdash;I think you are
Mr. Ladywell, who painted her portrait last season?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ladywell, colouring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may have heard her speak of Mr. Julian?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Ladywell, offering his hand.&nbsp; Then
by degrees their tongues wound closer round the subject of their sadness,
each tacitly owning to what he would not tell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw it,&rsquo; said Ladywell heavily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she look troubled?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least&mdash;bright and fresh as a May morning.&nbsp;
She has played me many a bitter trick, and poor Neigh too, a friend
of mine.&nbsp; But I cannot help forgiving her. . . .&nbsp; I saw a
carriage at the door, and strolled in.&nbsp; The ceremony was just proceeding,
so I sat down here.&nbsp; Well, I have done with Knollsea.&nbsp; The
place has no further interest for me now.&nbsp; I may own to you as
a friend, that if she had not been living here I should have studied
at some other coast&mdash;of course that&rsquo;s in confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand, quite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only arrived in the neighbourhood two days ago, and did
not set eyes upon her till this morning, she has kept so entirely indoors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the young men parted, and half-an-hour later the ingenuous Ladywell
came from the visitors&rsquo; inn by the shore, a man walking behind
him with a quantity of artists&rsquo; materials and appliances.&nbsp;
He went on board the steamer, which this morning had performed the passage
in safety.&nbsp; Ethelberta single having been the loadstone in the
cliffs that had attracted Ladywell hither, Ethelberta married was the
negative pole of the same, sending him away.&nbsp; And thus did a woman
put an end to the only opportunity of distinction, on Art-exhibition
walls, that ever offered itself to the tortuous ways, quaint alleys,
and marbled bluffs of Knollsea, as accessories in the picture of a winter
sea.</p>
<p>Christopher&rsquo;s interest in the village was of the same evaporating
nature.&nbsp; He looked upon the sea, and the great swell, and the waves
sending up a sound like the huzzas of multitudes; but all the wild scene
was irksome now.&nbsp; The ocean-bound steamers far away on the horizon
inspired him with no curiosity as to their destination; the house Ethelberta
had occupied was positively hateful; and he turned away to wait impatiently
for the hour at which he had promised to drive on to meet Sol at Corvsgate.</p>
<p>Sol and Chickerel plodded along the road, in order to skirt Enckworth
before the carrier came up.&nbsp; Reaching the top of a hill on their
way, they paused to look down on a peaceful scene.&nbsp; It was a park
and wood, glowing in all the matchless colours of late autumn, parapets
and pediments peering out from a central position afar.&nbsp; At the
bottom of the descent before them was a lodge, to which they now descended.&nbsp;
The gate stood invitingly open.&nbsp; Exclusiveness was no part of the
owner&rsquo;s instincts: one could see that at a glance.&nbsp; No appearance
of a well-rolled garden-path attached to the park-drive; as is the case
with many, betokening by the perfection of their surfaces their proprietor&rsquo;s
deficiency in hospitality.&nbsp; The approach was like a turnpike road
full of great ruts, clumsy mendings; bordered by trampled edges and
incursions upon the grass at pleasure.&nbsp; Butchers and bakers drove
as freely herein as peers and peeresses.&nbsp; Christening parties,
wedding companies, and funeral trains passed along by the doors of the
mansion without check or question.&nbsp; A wild untidiness in this particular
has its recommendations; for guarded grounds ever convey a suspicion
that their owner is young to landed possessions, as religious earnestnesss
implies newness of conversion, and conjugal tenderness recent marriage.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour being wanting as yet to Chickerel&rsquo;s time with
the carrier, Sol and himself, like the rest of the world when at leisure,
walked into the extensive stretch of grass and grove.&nbsp; It formed
a park so large that not one of its owners had ever wished it larger,
not one of its owner&rsquo;s rivals had ever failed to wish it smaller,
and not one of its owner&rsquo;s satellites had ever seen it without
praise.&nbsp; They somewhat avoided the roadway passing under the huge,
misshapen, ragged trees, and through fern brakes, ruddy and crisp in
their decay.&nbsp; On reaching a suitable eminence, the father and son
stood still to look upon the many-chimneyed building, or rather conglomeration
of buildings, to which these groves and glades formed a setting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will just give a glance,&rsquo; said Chickerel, &lsquo;and
then go away.&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t seem well to me that Ethelberta should
have this; it is too much.&nbsp; The sudden change will do her no good.&nbsp;
I never believe in anything that comes in the shape of wonderful luck.&nbsp;
As it comes, so it goes.&nbsp; Had she been brought home today to one
of those tenant-farms instead of these woods and walls, I could have
called it good fortune.&nbsp; What she should have done was glorify
herself by glorifying her own line of life, not by forsaking that line
for another.&nbsp; Better have been admired as a governess than shunned
as a peeress, which is what she will be.&nbsp; But it is just the same
everywhere in these days.&nbsp; Young men will rather wear a black coat
and starve than wear fustian and do well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One man to want such a monstrous house as that!&nbsp; Well,
&rsquo;tis a fine place.&nbsp; See, there&rsquo;s the carpenters&rsquo;
shops, the timber-yard, and everything, as if it were a little town.&nbsp;
Perhaps Berta may hire me for a job now and then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always knew she would cut herself off from us.&nbsp; She
marked for it from childhood, and she has finished the business thoroughly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is no matter, father, for why should we want to trouble
her?&nbsp; She may write, and I shall answer; but if she calls to see
me, I shall not return the visit; and if she meets me with her husband
or any of her new society about her, I shall behave as a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be best,&rsquo; said Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
now I must move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, by the sorcery of accident, before they had very far retraced
their steps an open carriage became visible round a bend in the drive.&nbsp;
Chickerel, with a servant&rsquo;s instinct, was for beating a retreat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us stand our ground.&nbsp;
We have already been seen, and we do no harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they stood still on the edge of the drive, and the carriage drew
near.&nbsp; It was a landau, and the sun shone in upon Lord Mountclere,
with Lady Mountclere sitting beside him, like Abishag beside King David.</p>
<p>Very blithe looked the viscount, for he rode upon a cherub to-day.&nbsp;
She appeared fresh, rosy, and strong, but dubious; though if mien was
anything, she was a viscountess twice over.&nbsp; Her dress was of a
dove-coloured material, with a bonnet to match, a little tufted white
feather resting on the top, like a truce-flag between the blood of noble
and vassal.&nbsp; Upon the cool grey of her shoulders hung a few locks
of hair, toned warm as fire by the sunshiny addition to its natural
hue.</p>
<p>Chickerel instinctively took off his hat; Sol did the same.</p>
<p>For only a moment did Ethelberta seem uncertain how to act.&nbsp;
But a solution to her difficulty was given by the face of her brother.&nbsp;
There she saw plainly at one glance more than a dozen speeches would
have told&mdash;for Sol&rsquo;s features thoroughly expressed his intention
that to him she was to be a stranger.&nbsp; Her eyes flew to Chickerel,
and he slightly shook his head.&nbsp; She understood them now.&nbsp;
With a tear in her eye for her father, and a sigh in her bosom for Sol,
she bowed in answer to their salute; her husband moved his hat and nodded,
and the carriage rolled on.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere might possibly be
making use of the fine morning in showing her the park and premises.&nbsp;
Chickerel, with a moist eye, now went on with his son towards the highroad.&nbsp;
When they reached the lodge, the lodge-keeper was walking in the sun,
smoking his pipe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; he said to Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any rejoicings at the Court to-day?&rsquo; the butler inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite the reverse.&nbsp; Not a soul there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
knowed anywhere at all.&nbsp; I had no idea of such a thing till he
brought my lady here.&nbsp; Not going off, neither.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
come home like the commonest couple in the land, and not even the bells
allowed to ring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked along the public road, and the carrier came in view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Sol, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
go further with you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s gone into the house; and suppose
she should run back without him to try to find us?&nbsp; It would be
cruel to disappoint her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bide about here for a quarter
of an hour, in case she should.&nbsp; Mr. Julian won&rsquo;t have passed
Corvsgate till I get there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, one or two of her old ways may be left in her still,
and it is not a bad thought.&nbsp; Then you will walk the rest of the
distance if you don&rsquo;t meet Mr. Julian?&nbsp; I must be in London
by the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any time to-night will do for me.&nbsp; I shall not begin
work until to-morrow, so that the four o&rsquo;clock train will answer
my purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus they parted, and Sol strolled leisurely back.&nbsp; The road
was quite deserted, and he lingered by the park fence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sol!&rsquo; said a bird-like voice; &lsquo;how did you come
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked up, and saw a figure peering down upon him from the top
of the park wall, the ground on the inside being higher than the road.&nbsp;
The speaker was to the expected Ethelberta what the moon is to the sun,
a star to the moon.&nbsp; It was Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Picotee!&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a little gate a quarter of a mile further on,&rsquo;
said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can meet there without your passing through
the big lodge.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be there as soon as you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol ascended the hill, passed through the second gate, and turned
back again, when he met Picotee coming forward under the trees.&nbsp;
They walked together in this secluded spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta says she wants to see you and father,&rsquo; said Picotee
breathlessly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must come in and make yourselves comfortable.&nbsp;
She had no idea you were here so secretly, and she didn&rsquo;t know
what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How vexed she will be!&nbsp; She thinks there is something
the matter&mdash;that you are angry with her for not telling you earlier.&nbsp;
But you will come in, Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t come in,&rsquo; said her brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&nbsp; It is such a big house, you can&rsquo;t think.&nbsp;
You need not come near the front apartments, if you think we shall be
ashamed of you in your working clothes.&nbsp; How came you not to dress
up a bit, Sol?&nbsp; Still, Berta won&rsquo;t mind it much.&nbsp; She
says Lord Mountclere must take her as she is, or he is kindly welcome
to leave her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well!&nbsp; I might have had a word or two to say about
that, but the time has gone by for it, worse luck.&nbsp; Perhaps it
is best that I have said nothing, and she has had her way.&nbsp; No,
I shan&rsquo;t come in, Picotee.&nbsp; Father is gone, and I am going
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Sol!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are rather put out at her acting like this&mdash;father
and I and all of us.&nbsp; She might have let us know about it beforehand,
even if she is a lady and we what we always was.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t
have let her down so terrible much to write a line.&nbsp; She might
have learnt something that would have led her to take a different step.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will see poor Berta?&nbsp; She has done no harm.&nbsp;
She was going to write long letters to all of you to-day, explaining
her wedding, and how she is going to help us all on in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol paused irresolutely.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t come in,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would disgrace her, for one thing, dressed
as I be; more than that, I don&rsquo;t want to come in.&nbsp; But I
should like to see her, if she would like to see me; and I&rsquo;ll
go up there to that little fir plantation, and walk up and down behind
it for exactly half-an-hour.&nbsp; She can come out to me there.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Sol had pointed as he spoke to a knot of young trees that hooded a knoll
a little way off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell her,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose they will be off somewhere, and she is busy getting
ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; They are not going to travel till next year.&nbsp;
Ethelberta does not want to go anywhere; and Lord Mountclere cannot
endure this changeable weather in any place but his own house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you will wait for her by the firs?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
her at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee left him, and Sol went across the glade.</p>
<h2>46. ENCKWORTH (continued)&mdash;THE ANGLEBURY HIGHWAY</h2>
<p>He had not paced behind the firs more than ten minutes when Ethelberta
appeared from the opposite side.&nbsp; At great inconvenience to herself,
she had complied with his request.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was trembling.&nbsp; She took her brother&rsquo;s hand,
and said, &lsquo;Is father, then, gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have been gone
likewise, but I thought you wanted to see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I did, and him too.&nbsp; Why did you come so mysteriously,
and, I must say, unbecomingly?&nbsp; I am afraid I did wrong in not
informing you of my intention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To yourself you may have.&nbsp; Father would have liked a
word with you before&mdash;you did it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You both looked so forbidding that I did not like to stop
the carriage when we passed you.&nbsp; I want to see him on an important
matter&mdash;his leaving Mrs. Doncastle&rsquo;s service at once.&nbsp;
I am going to write and beg her to dispense with a notice, which I have
no doubt she will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s very much upset about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My secrecy was perhaps an error of judgment,&rsquo; she said
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I had reasons.&nbsp; Why did you and my father
come here at all if you did not want to see me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We did want to see you up to a certain time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not come to prevent my marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We wished to see you before the marriage&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
say more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you might not approve of what I had done,&rsquo;
said Ethelberta mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;But a time may come when you
will approve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be harsh, Sol.&nbsp; A coronet covers a multitude
of sins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A coronet: good Lord&mdash;and you my sister!&nbsp; Look at
my hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sol extended his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look how my
thumb stands out at the root, as if it were out of joint, and that hard
place inside there.&nbsp; Did you ever see anything so ugly as that
hand&mdash;a misshaped monster, isn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; That comes from
the jackplane, and my pushing against it day after day and year after
year.&nbsp; If I were found drowned or buried, dressed or undressed,
in fustian or in broadcloth, folk would look at my hand and say, &ldquo;That
man&rsquo;s a carpenter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well now, how can a man, branded
with work as I be, be brother to a viscountess without something being
wrong?&nbsp; Of course there&rsquo;s something wrong in it, or he wouldn&rsquo;t
have married you&mdash;something which won&rsquo;t be righted without
terrible suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are mistaken.&nbsp;
There is no such wonderful quality in a title in these days.&nbsp; What
I really am is second wife to a quiet old country nobleman, who has
given up society.&nbsp; What more commonplace?&nbsp; My life will be
as simple, even more simple, than it was before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta, you have worked to false lines.&nbsp; A creeping up
among the useless lumber of our nation that&rsquo;ll be the first to
burn if there comes a flare.&nbsp; I never see such a deserter of your
own lot as you be!&nbsp; But you were always like it, Berta, and I am
ashamed of ye.&nbsp; More than that, a good woman never marries twice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are too hard, Sol,&rsquo; said the poor viscountess, almost
crying.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done it all for you!&nbsp; Even if I
have made a mistake, and given my ambition an ignoble turn, don&rsquo;t
tell me so now, or you may do more harm in a minute than you will cure
in a lifetime.&nbsp; It is absurd to let republican passions so blind
you to fact.&nbsp; A family which can be honourably traced through history
for five hundred years, does affect the heart of a person not entirely
hardened against romance.&nbsp; Whether you like the peerage or no,
they appeal to our historical sense and love of old associations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for history.&nbsp; Prophecy is the only
thing can do poor men any good.&nbsp; When you were a girl, you wouldn&rsquo;t
drop a curtsey to &rsquo;em, historical or otherwise, and there you
were right.&nbsp; But, instead of sticking to such principles, you must
needs push up, so as to get girls such as you were once to curtsey to
you, not even thinking marriage with a bad man too great a price to
pay for&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bad man?&nbsp; What do you mean by that?&nbsp; Lord Mountclere
is rather old, but he&rsquo;s worthy.&nbsp; What did you mean, Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&mdash;a mere sommat to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Picotee emerged from behind a tree, and told her sister
that Lord Mountclere was looking for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Sol, I cannot explain all to you now,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will send for you in London.&rsquo;&nbsp; She wished him goodbye,
and they separated, Picotee accompanying Sol a little on his way.</p>
<p>Ethelberta was greatly perturbed by this meeting.&nbsp; After retracing
her steps a short distance, she still felt so distressed and unpresentable
that she resolved not to allow Lord Mountclere to see her till the clouds
had somewhat passed off; it was but a bare act of justice to him to
hide from his sight such a bridal mood as this.&nbsp; It was better
to keep him waiting than to make him positively unhappy.&nbsp; She turned
aside, and went up the valley, where the park merged in miles of wood
and copse.</p>
<p>She opened an iron gate and entered the wood, casually interested
in the vast variety of colours that the half-fallen leaves of the season
wore: more, much more, occupied with personal thought.&nbsp; The path
she pursued became gradually involved in bushes as well as trees, giving
to the spot the character rather of a coppice than a wood.&nbsp; Perceiving
that she had gone far enough, Ethelberta turned back by a path which
at this point intersected that by which she had approached, and promised
a more direct return towards the Court.&nbsp; She had not gone many
steps among the hazels, which here formed a perfect thicket, when she
observed a belt of holly-bushes in their midst; towards the outskirts
of these an opening on her left hand directly led, thence winding round
into a clear space of greensward, which they completely enclosed.&nbsp;
On this isolated and mewed-up bit of lawn stood a timber-built cottage,
having ornamental barge-boards, balconettes, and porch.&nbsp; It was
an erection interesting enough as an experiment, and grand as a toy,
but as a building contemptible.</p>
<p>A blue gauze of smoke floated over the chimney, as if somebody was
living there; round towards the side some empty hen-coops were piled
away; while under the hollies were divers frameworks of wire netting
and sticks, showing that birds were kept here at some seasons of the
year.</p>
<p>Being lady of all she surveyed, Ethelberta crossed the leafy sward,
and knocked at the door.&nbsp; She was interested in knowing the purpose
of the peculiar little edifice.</p>
<p>The door was opened by a woman wearing a clean apron upon a not very
clean gown.&nbsp; Ethelberta asked who lived in so pretty a place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Gruchette,&rsquo; the servant replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
she is not here now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she live here alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;excepting myself and a fellow-servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She lives here to attend to the pheasants and poultry, because
she is so clever in managing them.&nbsp; They are brought here from
the keeper&rsquo;s over the hill.&nbsp; Her father was a fancier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Gruchette attends to the birds, and two servants attend
to Miss Gruchette?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to tell the truth, m&rsquo;m, the servants do almost
all of it.&nbsp; Still, that&rsquo;s what Miss Gruchette is here for.&nbsp;
Would you like to see the house?&nbsp; It is pretty.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
woman spoke with hesitation, as if in doubt between the desire of earning
a shilling and the fear that Ethelberta was not a stranger.&nbsp; That
Ethelberta was Lady Mountclere she plainly did not dream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear I can scarcely stay long enough; yet I will just look
in,&rsquo; said Ethelberta.&nbsp; And as soon as they had crossed the
threshold she was glad of having done so.</p>
<p>The cottage internally may be described as a sort of boudoir extracted
from the bulk of a mansion and deposited in a wood.&nbsp; The front
room was filled with nicknacks, curious work-tables, filigree baskets,
twisted brackets supporting statuettes, in which the grotesque in every
case ruled the design; love-birds, in gilt cages; French bronzes, wonderful
boxes, needlework of strange patterns, and other attractive objects.&nbsp;
The apartment was one of those which seem to laugh in a visitor&rsquo;s
face and on closer examination express frivolity more distinctly than
by words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Gruchette is here to keep the fowls?&rsquo; said Ethelberta,
in a puzzled tone, after a survey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t keep her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta did not attempt to understand, and ceased to occupy her
mind with the matter.&nbsp; They came from the cottage to the door,
where she gave the woman a trifling sum, and turned to leave.&nbsp;
But footsteps were at that moment to be heard beating among the leaves
on the other side of the hollies, and Ethelberta waited till the walkers
should have passed.&nbsp; The voices of two men reached herself and
the woman as they stood.&nbsp; They were close to the house, yet screened
from it by the holly-bushes, when one could be heard to say distinctly,
as if with his face turned to the cottage&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Mountclere gone for good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so.&nbsp; Ha-ha!&nbsp; So come, so go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speakers passed on, their backs becoming visible through the
opening.&nbsp; They appeared to be woodmen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What Lady Mountclere do they mean?&rsquo; said Ethelberta.</p>
<p>The woman blushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;They meant Miss Gruchette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;a nickname.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman whispered why in a story of about two minutes&rsquo; length.&nbsp;
Ethelberta turned pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she going to return?&rsquo; she inquired, in a thin hard
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; next week.&nbsp; You know her, m&rsquo;m?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I am a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the better.&nbsp; I may tell you, then, that an old
tale is flying about the neighbourhood&mdash;that Lord Mountclere was
privately married to another woman, at Knollsea, this morning early.&nbsp;
Can it be true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe it to be true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that she is of no family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of no family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&nbsp; Then the Lord only knows what will become of
the poor thing.&nbsp; There will be murder between &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Between whom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her and the lady who lives here.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t budge
an inch&mdash;not she!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ethelberta moved aside.&nbsp; A shade seemed to overspread the world,
the sky, the trees, and the objects in the foreground.&nbsp; She kept
her face away from the woman, and, whispering a reply to her Good-morning,
passed through the hollies into the leaf-strewn path.&nbsp; As soon
as she came to a large trunk she placed her hands against it and rested
her face upon them.&nbsp; She drew herself lower down, lower, lower,
till she crouched upon the leaves.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay&mdash;&rsquo;tis
what father and Sol meant!&nbsp; O Heaven!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She soon arose, and went on her way to the house.&nbsp; Her fair
features were firmly set, and she scarcely heeded the path in the concentration
which had followed her paroxysm.&nbsp; When she reached the park proper
she became aware of an excitement that was in progress there.</p>
<p>Ethelberta&rsquo;s absence had become unaccountable to Lord Mountclere,
who could hardly permit her retirement from his sight for a minute.&nbsp;
But at first he had made due allowance for her eccentricity as a woman
of genius, and would not take notice of the half-hour&rsquo;s desertion,
unpardonable as it might have been in other classes of wives.&nbsp;
Then he had inquired, searched, been alarmed: he had finally sent men-servants
in all directions about the park to look for her.&nbsp; He feared she
had fallen out of a window, down a well, or into the lake.&nbsp; The
next stage of search was to have been drags and grapnels: but Ethelberta
entered the house.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere rushed forward to meet her, and such was her contrivance
that he noticed no change.&nbsp; The searchers were called in, Ethelberta
explaining that she had merely obeyed the wish of her brother in going
out to meet him.&nbsp; Picotee, who had returned from her walk with
Sol, was upstairs in one of the rooms which had been allotted to her.&nbsp;
Ethelberta managed to run in there on her way upstairs to her own chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Picotee, put your things on again,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are the only friend I have in this house, and I want one
badly.&nbsp; Go to Sol, and deliver this message to him&mdash;that I
want to see him at once.&nbsp; You must overtake him, if you walk all
the way to Anglebury.&nbsp; But the train does not leave till four,
so that there is plenty of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; said Picotee.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot
walk all the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will have to do that&mdash;I hope
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is going to stop at Corvsgate to have a bit of lunch: I
might overtake him there, if I must!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And tell him to come to the east passage door.&nbsp;
It is that door next to the entrance to the stable-yard.&nbsp; There
is a little yew-tree outside it.&nbsp; On second thoughts you, dear,
must not come back.&nbsp; Wait at Corvsgate in the little inn parlour
till Sol comes to you again.&nbsp; You will probably then have to go
home to London alone; but do not mind it.&nbsp; The worst part for you
will be in going from the station to the Crescent; but nobody will molest
you in a four-wheel cab: you have done it before.&nbsp; However, he
will tell you if this is necessary when he gets back.&nbsp; I can best
fight my battles alone.&nbsp; You shall have a letter from me the day
after to-morrow, stating where I am.&nbsp; I shall not be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what is it so dreadful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing to frighten you.&rsquo;&nbsp; But she spoke with a
breathlessness that completely nullified the assurance.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is merely that I find I must come to an explanation with Lord Mountclere
before I can live here permanently, and I cannot stipulate with him
while I am here in his power.&nbsp; Till I write, good-bye.&nbsp; Your
things are not unpacked, so let them remain here for the present&mdash;they
can be sent for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Picotee, more agitated than her sister, but never questioning
her orders, went downstairs and out of the house.&nbsp; She ran across
the shrubberies, into the park, and to the gate whereat Sol had emerged
some half-hour earlier.&nbsp; She trotted along upon the turnpike road
like a lost doe, crying as she went at the new trouble which had come
upon Berta, whatever that trouble might be.&nbsp; Behind her she heard
wheels and the stepping of a horse, but she was too concerned to turn
her head.&nbsp; The pace of the vehicle slackened, however, when it
was abreast of Picotee, and she looked up to see Christopher as the
driver.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Chickerel!&rsquo; he said, with surprise.</p>
<p>Picotee had quickly looked down again, and she murmured, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher asked what he could not help asking in the circumstances,
&lsquo;Would you like to ride?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be glad,&rsquo; said she, overcoming her flurry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am anxious to overtake my brother Sol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have arranged to pick him up at Corvsgate,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>He descended, and assisted her to mount beside him, and drove on
again, almost in silence.&nbsp; He was inclined to believe that some
supernatural legerdemain had to do with these periodic impacts of Picotee
on his path.&nbsp; She sat mute and melancholy till they were within
half-a-mile of Corvsgate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she said then, perceiving Sol upon the road,
&lsquo;there is my brother; I will get down now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was going to ride on to Anglebury with me,&rsquo; said
Julian.</p>
<p>Picotee did not reply, and Sol turned round.&nbsp; Seeing her he
instantly exclaimed, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Picotee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She explained to him that he was to go back immediately, and meet
her sister at the door by the yew, as Ethelberta had charged her.&nbsp;
Christopher, knowing them so well, was too much an interested member
of the group to be left out of confidence, and she included him in her
audience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are you to do?&rsquo; said Sol to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am to wait at Corvsgate till you come to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rsquo; Sol muttered, with a gloomy
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong; and it was only to
be expected; that&rsquo;s what I say, Mr. Julian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If necessary I can take care of Miss Chickerel till you come,&rsquo;
said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I will return
to you as soon as I can, at the &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; Inn, just ahead.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis very awkward for you to be so burdened by us, Mr. Julian;
but we are in a trouble that I don&rsquo;t yet see the bottom of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Christopher kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will
wait for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then drove on with Picotee to the inn, which was not far off,
and Sol returned again to Enckworth.&nbsp; Feeling somewhat like a thief
in the night, he zigzagged through the park, behind belts and knots
of trees, until he saw the yew, dark and clear, as if drawn in ink upon
the fair face of the mansion.&nbsp; The way up to it was in a little
cutting between shrubs, the door being a private entrance, sunk below
the surface of the lawn, and invisible from other parts of the same
front.&nbsp; As soon as he reached it, Ethelberta opened it at once,
as if she had listened for his footsteps.</p>
<p>She took him along a passage in the basement, up a flight of steps,
and into a huge, solitary, chill apartment.&nbsp; It was the ball-room.&nbsp;
Spacious mirrors in gilt frames formed panels in the lower part of the
walls, the remainder being toned in sage-green.&nbsp; In a recess between
each mirror was a statue.&nbsp; The ceiling rose in a segmental curve,
and bore sprawling upon its face gilt figures of wanton goddesses, cupids,
satyrs with tambourines, drums, and trumpets, the whole ceiling seeming
alive with them.&nbsp; But the room was very gloomy now, there being
little light admitted from without, and the reflections from the mirrors
gave a depressing coldness to the scene.&nbsp; It was a place intended
to look joyous by night, and whatever it chose to look by day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are safe here,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we must
listen for footsteps.&nbsp; I have only five minutes: Lord Mountclere
is waiting for me.&nbsp; I mean to leave this place, come what may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Sol, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell you&mdash;something has occurred.&nbsp; God
has got me in his power at last, and is going to scourge me for my bad
doings&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it seems like.&nbsp; Sol, listen to me,
and do exactly what I say.&nbsp; Go to Anglebury, hire a brougham, bring
it on as far as Little Enckworth: you will have to meet me with it at
one of the park gates later in the evening&mdash;probably the west,
at half-past seven.&nbsp; Leave it at the village with the man, come
on here on foot, and stay under the trees till just before six: it will
then be quite dark, and you must stand under the projecting balustrade
a little further on than the door you came in by.&nbsp; I will just
step upon the balcony over it, and tell you more exactly than I can
now the precise time that I shall be able to slip out, and where the
carriage is to be waiting.&nbsp; But it may not be safe to speak on
account of his closeness to me&mdash;I will hand down a note.&nbsp;
I find it is impossible to leave the house by daylight&mdash;I am certain
to be pursued&mdash;he already suspects something.&nbsp; Now I must
be going, or he will be here, for he watches my movements because of
some accidental words that escaped me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta, I shan&rsquo;t have anything to do with this,&rsquo;
said Sol.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only going to Rouen, to Aunt Charlotte!&rsquo; she implored.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want to get to Southampton, to be in time for the midnight
steamer.&nbsp; When I am at Rouen I can negotiate with Lord Mountclere
the terms on which I will return to him.&nbsp; It is the only chance
I have of rooting out a scandal and a disgrace which threatens the beginning
of my life here!&nbsp; My letters to him, and his to me, can be forwarded
through you or through father, and he will not know where I am.&nbsp;
Any woman is justified in adopting such a course to bring her husband
to a sense of her dignity.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t go away now, it will
end in a permanent separation.&nbsp; If I leave at once, and stipulate
that he gets rid of her, we may be reconciled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help you: you must stick to your husband.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t like them, or any of their sort, barring about three or
four, for the reason that they despise me and all my sort.&nbsp; But,
Ethelberta, for all that I&rsquo;ll play fair with them.&nbsp; No half-and-half
trimming business.&nbsp; You have joined &rsquo;em, and &rsquo;rayed
yourself against us; and there you&rsquo;d better bide.&nbsp; You have
married your man, and your duty is towards him.&nbsp; I know what he
is and so does father; but if I were to help you to run away now, I
should scorn myself more than I scorn him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that, or for any such politics!&nbsp;
The Mountclere line is noble, and how was I to know that this member
was not noble, too?&nbsp; As the representative of an illustrious family
I was taken with him, but as a man&mdash;I must shun him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you shun him?&nbsp; You have married him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, I won&rsquo;t stay!&nbsp; Neither law nor gospel
demands it of me after what I have learnt.&nbsp; And if law and gospel
did demand it, I would not stay.&nbsp; And if you will not help me to
escape, I go alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better not try any such wild thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The creaking of a door was heard.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Sol,&rsquo; she
said appealingly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t go into the question whether I
am right or wrong&mdash;only remember that I am very unhappy.&nbsp;
Do help me&mdash;I have no other person in the world to ask!&nbsp; Be
under the balcony at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Say you will&mdash;I must
go&mdash;say you will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think,&rsquo; said Sol, very much disturbed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, don&rsquo;t cry; I&rsquo;ll try to be under the balcony,
at any rate.&nbsp; I cannot promise more, but I&rsquo;ll try to be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She opened in the panelling one of the old-fashioned concealed modes
of exit known as jib-doors, which it was once the custom to construct
without architraves in the walls of large apartments, so as not to interfere
with the general design of the room.&nbsp; Sol found himself in a narrow
passage, running down the whole length of the ball-room, and at the
same time he heard Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s voice within, talking to
Ethelberta.&nbsp; Sol&rsquo;s escape had been marvellous: as it was
the viscount might have seen her tears.&nbsp; He passed down some steps,
along an area from which he could see into a row of servants&rsquo;
offices, among them a kitchen with a fireplace flaming like an altar
of sacrifice.&nbsp; Nobody seemed to be concerned about him; there were
workmen upon the premises, and he nearly matched them.&nbsp; At last
he got again into the shrubberies and to the side of the park by which
he had entered.</p>
<p>On reaching Corvsgate he found Picotee in the parlour of the little
inn, as he had directed.&nbsp; Mr. Julian, she said, had walked up to
the ruins, and would be back again in a few minutes.&nbsp; Sol ordered
the horse to be put in, and by the time it was ready Christopher came
down from the hill.&nbsp; Room was made for Sol by opening the flap
of the dogcart, and Christopher drove on.</p>
<p>He was anxious to know the trouble, and Sol was not reluctant to
share the burden of it with one whom he believed to be a friend.&nbsp;
He told, scrap by scrap, the strange request of Ethelberta.&nbsp; Christopher,
though ignorant of Ethelberta&rsquo;s experience that morning, instantly
assumed that the discovery of some concealed spectre had led to this
precipitancy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When does she wish you to meet her with the carriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably at half-past seven, at the west lodge; but that is
to be finally fixed by a note she will hand down to me from the balcony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which balcony?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nearest to the yew-tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At what time will she hand the note?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the Court clock strikes six, she says.&nbsp; And if I am
not there to take her instructions of course she will give up the idea,
which is just what I want her to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher begged Sol to go.&nbsp; Whether Ethelberta was right
or wrong, he did not stop to inquire.&nbsp; She was in trouble; she
was too clear-headed to be in trouble without good reason; and she wanted
assistance out of it.&nbsp; But such was Sol&rsquo;s nature that the
more he reflected the more determined was he in not giving way to her
entreaty.&nbsp; By the time that they reached Anglebury he repented
having given way so far as to withhold a direct refusal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can do no good,&rsquo; he said mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is better to nip her notion in its beginning.&nbsp; She says she wants
to fly to Rouen, and from there arrange terms with him.&nbsp; But it
can&rsquo;t be done&mdash;she should have thought of terms before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher made no further reply.&nbsp; Leaving word at the &lsquo;Red
Lion&rsquo; that a man was to be sent to take the horse of him, he drove
directly onwards to the station.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t mean to help her?&rsquo; said Julian,
when Sol took the tickets&mdash;one for himself and one for Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I serve her best by leaving her alone!&rsquo; said Sol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has married him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in distress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has married him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sol and Picotee took their seats, Picotee upbraiding her brother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can go by myself!&rsquo; she said, in tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
go back for Berta, Sol.&nbsp; She said I was to go home alone, and I
can do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not.&nbsp; It is not right for you to be hiring cabs
and driving across London at midnight.&nbsp; Berta should have known
better than propose it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was flurried.&nbsp; Go, Sol!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But her entreaty was fruitless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you got your ticket, Mr. Julian?&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose we shall go together till we get near Melchester?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not got my ticket yet&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be back in two
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The minutes went by, and Christopher did not reappear.&nbsp; The
train moved off: Christopher was seen running up the platform, as if
in a vain hope to catch it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has missed the train,&rsquo; said Sol.&nbsp; Picotee looked
disappointed, and said nothing.&nbsp; They were soon out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forgive me for such a hollow pretence!&rsquo; said Christopher
to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he would have been uneasy had he known
I wished to stay behind.&nbsp; I cannot leave her in trouble like this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the &lsquo;Red Lion&rsquo; with the manner and movement
of a man who after a lifetime of desultoriness had at last found something
to do.&nbsp; It was now getting late in the afternoon.&nbsp; Christopher
ordered a one-horse brougham at the inn, and entering it was driven
out of the town towards Enckworth as the evening shades were beginning
to fall.&nbsp; They passed into the hamlet of Little Enckworth at half-past
five, and drew up at a beer-house at the end.&nbsp; Jumping out here,
Julian told the man to wait till he should return.</p>
<p>Thus far he had exactly obeyed her orders to Sol.&nbsp; He hoped
to be able to obey them throughout, and supply her with the aid her
brother refused.&nbsp; He also hoped that the change in the personality
of her confederate would make no difference to her intention.&nbsp;
That he was putting himself in a wrong position he allowed, but time
and attention were requisite for such analysis: meanwhile Ethelberta
was in trouble.&nbsp; On the one hand was she waiting hopefully for
Sol; on the other was Sol many miles on his way to town; between them
was himself.</p>
<p>He ran with all his might towards Enckworth Park, mounted the lofty
stone steps by the lodge, saw the dark bronze figures on the piers through
the twilight, and then proceeded to thread the trees.&nbsp; Among these
he struck a light for a moment: it was ten minutes to six.&nbsp; In
another five minutes he was panting beneath the walls of her house.</p>
<p>Enckworth Court was not unknown to Christopher, for he had frequently
explored that spot in his Sandbourne days.&nbsp; He perceived now why
she had selected that particular balcony for handing down directions;
it was the only one round the house that was low enough to be reached
from the outside, the basement here being a little way sunk in the ground.</p>
<p>He went close under, turned his face outwards, and waited.&nbsp;
About a foot over his head was the stone floor of the balcony, forming
a ceiling to his position.&nbsp; At his back, two or three feet behind,
was a blank wall&mdash;the wall of the house.&nbsp; In front of him
was the misty park, crowned by a sky sparkling with winter stars.&nbsp;
This was abruptly cut off upward by the dark edge of the balcony which
overhung him.</p>
<p>It was as if some person within the room above had been awaiting
his approach.&nbsp; He had scarcely found time to observe his situation
when a human hand and portion of a bare arm were thrust between the
balusters, descended a little way from the edge of the balcony, and
remained hanging across the starlit sky.&nbsp; Something was between
the fingers.&nbsp; Christopher lifted his hand, took the scrap, which
was paper, and the arm was withdrawn.&nbsp; As it withdrew, a jewel
on one of the fingers sparkled in the rays of a large planet that rode
in the opposite sky.</p>
<p>Light steps retreated from the balcony, and a window closed.&nbsp;
Christopher had almost held his breath lest Ethelberta should discover
him at the critical moment to be other than Sol, and mar her deliverance
by her alarm.&nbsp; The still silence was anything but silence to him;
he felt as if he were listening to the clanging chorus of an oratorio.&nbsp;
And then he could fancy he heard words between Ethelberta and the viscount
within the room; they were evidently at very close quarters, and dexterity
must have been required of her.&nbsp; He went on tiptoe across the gravel
to the grass, and once on that he strode in the direction whence he
had come.&nbsp; By the thick trunk of one of a group of aged trees he
stopped to get a light, just as the Court clock struck six in loud long
tones.&nbsp; The transaction had been carried out, through her impatience
possibly, four or five minutes before the time appointed.</p>
<p>The note contained, in a shaken hand, in which, however, the well-known
characters were distinguishable, these words in pencil:</p>
<p>&lsquo;At half-past seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Just outside the north
lodge; don&rsquo;t fail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the time she had suggested to Sol as that which would probably
best suit her escape, if she could escape at all.&nbsp; She had changed
the place from the west to the north lodge&mdash;nothing else.&nbsp;
The latter was certainly more secluded, though a trifle more remote
from the course of the proposed journey; there was just time enough
and none to spare for fetching the brougham from Little Enckworth to
the lodge, the village being two miles off.&nbsp; The few minutes gained
by her readiness at the balcony were useful now.&nbsp; He started at
once for the village, diverging somewhat to observe the spot appointed
for the meeting.&nbsp; It was excellently chosen; the gate appeared
to be little used, the lane outside it was covered with trees, and all
around was silent as the grave.&nbsp; After this hasty survey by the
wan starlight, he hastened on to Little Enckworth.</p>
<p>An hour and a quarter later a little brougham without lamps was creeping
along by the park wall towards this spot.&nbsp; The leaves were so thick
upon the unfrequented road that the wheels could not be heard, and the
horse&rsquo;s pacing made scarcely more noise than a rabbit would have
done in limping along.&nbsp; The vehicle progressed slowly, for they
were in good time.&nbsp; About ten yards from the park entrance it stopped,
and Christopher stepped out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may have to wait here ten minutes,&rsquo; he said to the
driver.&nbsp; &lsquo;And then shall we be able to reach Anglebury in
time for the up mail-train to Southampton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half-past seven, half-past eight, half-past nine&mdash;two
hours.&nbsp; O yes, sir, easily.&nbsp; A young lady in the case perhaps,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope she&rsquo;ll be done honestly by, even if she
is of humble station.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis best, and cheapest too, in the
long run.&rsquo;&nbsp; The coachman was apparently imagining the dove
about to flit away to be one of the pretty maid-servants that abounded
in Enckworth Court; such escapades as these were not unfrequent among
them, a fair face having been deemed a sufficient recommendation to
service in that house, without too close an inquiry into character,
since the death of the first viscountess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then, silence; and listen for a footstep at the gate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such calmness as there was in the musician&rsquo;s voice had been
produced by considerable effort.&nbsp; For his heart had begun to beat
fast and loud as he strained his attentive ear to catch the footfall
of a woman who could only be his illegally.</p>
<p>The obscurity was as great as a starry sky would permit it to be.&nbsp;
Beneath the trees where the carriage stood the darkness was total.</p>
<h2>47. ENCKWORTH AND ITS PRECINCTS&mdash;MELCHESTER</h2>
<p>To be wise after the event is often to act foolishly with regard
to it; and to preserve the illusion which has led to the event would
frequently be a course that omniscience itself could not find fault
with.&nbsp; Reaction with Ethelberta was complete, and the more violent
in that it threatened to be useless.&nbsp; Sol&rsquo;s bitter chiding
had been the first thing to discompose her fortitude.&nbsp; It reduced
her to a consciousness that she had allowed herself to be coerced in
her instincts, and yet had not triumphed in her duty.&nbsp; She might
have pleased her family better by pleasing her tastes, and have entirely
avoided the grim irony of the situation disclosed later in the day.</p>
<p>After the second interview with Sol she was to some extent composed
in mind by being able to nurse a definite intention.&nbsp; As momentum
causes the narrowest wheel to stand upright, a scheme, fairly imbibed,
will give the weakest some power to maintain a position stoically.</p>
<p>In the temporary absence of Lord Mountclere, about six o&rsquo;clock,
she slipped out upon the balcony and handed down a note.&nbsp; To her
relief, a hand received it instantly.</p>
<p>The hour and a half wanting to half-past seven she passed with great
effort.&nbsp; The main part of the time was occupied by dinner, during
which she attempted to devise some scheme for leaving him without suspicion
just before the appointed moment.</p>
<p>Happily, and as if by a Providence, there was no necessity for any
such thing.</p>
<p>A little while before the half-hour, when she moved to rise from
dinner, he also arose, tenderly begging her to excuse him for a few
minutes, that he might go and write an important note to his lawyer,
until that moment forgotten, though the postman was nearly due.&nbsp;
She heard him retire along the corridor and shut himself into his study,
his promised time of return being a quarter of an hour thence.</p>
<p>Five minutes after that memorable parting Ethelberta came from the
little door by the bush of yew, well and thickly wrapped up from head
to heels.&nbsp; She skimmed across the park and under the boughs like
a shade, mounting then the stone steps for pedestrians which were fixed
beside the park gates here as at all the lodges.&nbsp; Outside and below
her she saw an oblong shape&mdash;it was a brougham, and it had been
drawn forward close to the bottom of the steps that she might not have
an inch further to go on foot than to this barrier.&nbsp; The whole
precinct was thronged with trees; half their foliage being overhead,
the other half under foot, for the gardeners had not yet begun to rake
and collect the leaves; thus it was that her dress rustled as she descended
the steps.</p>
<p>The carriage door was held open by the driver, and she entered instantly.&nbsp;
He shut her in, and mounted to his seat.&nbsp; As they drove away she
became conscious of another person inside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! Sol&mdash;it is done!&rsquo; she whispered, believing the
man to be her brother.&nbsp; Her companion made no reply.</p>
<p>Ethelberta, familiar with Sol&rsquo;s moods of troubled silence,
did not press for an answer.&nbsp; It was, indeed, certain that Sol&rsquo;s
assistance would have been given under a sullen protest; even if unwilling
to disappoint her, he might well have been taciturn and angry at her
course.</p>
<p>They sat in silence, and in total darkness.&nbsp; The road ascended
an incline, the horse&rsquo;s tramp being still deadened by the carpet
of leaves.&nbsp; Then the large trees on either hand became interspersed
by a low brushwood of varied sorts, from which a large bird occasionally
flew, in its fright at their presence beating its wings recklessly against
the hard stems with force enough to cripple the delicate quills.&nbsp;
It showed how deserted was the spot after nightfall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sol?&rsquo; said Ethelberta again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not talk
to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She now noticed that her fellow-traveller kept his head and his whole
person as snugly back in the corner, out of her way, as it was possible
to do.&nbsp; She was not exactly frightened, but she could not understand
the reason.&nbsp; The carriage gave a quick turn, and stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are we now?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall we get
to Anglebury by nine?&nbsp; What is the time, Sol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will see,&rsquo; replied her companion.&nbsp; They were
the first words he had uttered.</p>
<p>The voice was so different from her brother&rsquo;s that she was
terrified; her limbs quivered.&nbsp; In another instant the speaker
had struck a wax vesta, and holding it erect in his fingers he looked
her in the face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hee-hee-hee!&rsquo;&nbsp; The laugher was her husband the
viscount.</p>
<p>He laughed again, and his eyes gleamed like a couple of tarnished
brass buttons in the light of the wax match.</p>
<p>Ethelberta might have fallen dead with the shock, so terrible and
hideous was it.&nbsp; Yet she did not.&nbsp; She neither shrieked nor
fainted; but no poor January fieldfare was ever colder, no ice-house
more dank with perspiration, than she was then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very pleasant joke, my dear&mdash;hee-hee!&nbsp; And no
more than was to be expected on this merry, happy day of our lives.&nbsp;
Nobody enjoys a good jest more than I do: I always enjoyed a jest&mdash;hee-hee!&nbsp;
Now we are in the dark again; and we will alight and walk.&nbsp; The
path is too narrow for the carriage, but it will not be far for you.&nbsp;
Take your husband&rsquo;s arm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he had been speaking a defiant pride had sprung up in her,
instigating her to conceal every weakness.&nbsp; He had opened the carriage
door and stepped out.&nbsp; She followed, taking the offered arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the horse and carriage to the stables,&rsquo; said the
viscount to the coachman, who was his own servant, the vehicle and horse
being also his.&nbsp; The coachman turned the horse&rsquo;s head and
vanished down the woodland track by which they had ascended.</p>
<p>The viscount moved on, uttering private chuckles as numerous as a
woodpecker&rsquo;s taps, and Ethelberta with him.&nbsp; She walked as
by a miracle, but she would walk.&nbsp; She would have died rather than
not have walked then.</p>
<p>She perceived now that they were somewhere in Enckworth wood.&nbsp;
As they went, she noticed a faint shine upon the ground on the other
side of the viscount, which showed her that they were walking beside
a wet ditch.&nbsp; She remembered having seen it in the morning: it
was a shallow ditch of mud.&nbsp; She might push him in, and run, and
so escape before he could extricate himself.&nbsp; It would not hurt
him.&nbsp; It was her last chance.&nbsp; She waited a moment for the
opportunity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are one to one, and I am the stronger!&rsquo; she at last
exclaimed triumphantly, and lifted her hand for a thrust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, darling, we are one to half-a-dozen, and
you considerably the weaker,&rsquo; he tenderly replied, stepping back
adroitly, and blowing a whistle.&nbsp; At once the bushes seemed to
be animated in four or five places.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John?&rsquo; he said, in the direction of one of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my lord,&rsquo; replied a voice from the bush, and a
keeper came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another man advanced from another bush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right.&nbsp; Remain where you are for the present.&nbsp;
Is Tomkins there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my lord,&rsquo; said a man from another part of the thicket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You go and keep watch by the further lodge: there are poachers
about.&nbsp; Where is Strongway?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just below, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him and his brother to go to the west gate, and walk
up and down.&nbsp; Let them search round it, among the trees inside.&nbsp;
Anybody there who cannot give a good account of himself to be brought
before me to-morrow morning.&nbsp; I am living at the cottage at present.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all I have to say to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, turning round
to Ethelberta: &lsquo;Now, dearest, we will walk a little further if
you are able.&nbsp; I have provided that your friends shall be taken
care of.&rsquo;&nbsp; He tried to pull her hand towards him, gently,
like a cat opening a door.</p>
<p>They walked a little onward, and Lord Mountclere spoke again, with
imperturbable good-humour:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you a story, to pass the time away.&nbsp; I have
learnt the art from you&mdash;your mantle has fallen upon me, and all
your inspiration with it.&nbsp; Listen, dearest.&nbsp; I saw a young
man come to the house to-day.&nbsp; Afterwards I saw him cross a passage
in your company.&nbsp; You entered the ball-room with him.&nbsp; That
room is a treacherous place.&nbsp; It is panelled with wood, and between
the panels and the walls are passages for the servants, opening from
the room by doors hidden in the woodwork.&nbsp; Lady Mountclere knew
of one of these, and made use of it to let out her conspirator; Lord
Mountclere knew of another, and made use of it to let in himself.&nbsp;
His sight is not good, but his ears are unimpaired.&nbsp; A meeting
was arranged to take place at the west gate at half-past seven, unless
a note handed from the balcony mentioned another time and place.&nbsp;
He heard it all&mdash;hee-hee!</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Lady Mountclere&rsquo;s confederate came for the note,
I was in waiting above, and handed one down a few minutes before the
hour struck, confirming the time, but changing the place.&nbsp; When
Lady Mountclere handed down her note, just as the clock was striking,
her confederate had gone, and I was standing beneath the balcony to
receive it.&nbsp; She dropped it into her husband&rsquo;s hands&mdash;ho-ho-ho-ho!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere ordered a brougham to be at the west lodge,
as fixed by Lady Mountclere&rsquo;s note.&nbsp; Probably Lady Mountclere&rsquo;s
friend ordered a brougham to be at the north gate, as fixed by my note,
written in imitation of Lady Mountclere&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Lady Mountclere
came to the spot she had mentioned, and like a good wife rushed into
the arms of her husband&mdash;hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As if by an ungovernable impulse, Ethelberta broke into laughter
also&mdash;laughter which had a wild unnatural sound; it was hysterical.&nbsp;
She sank down upon the leaves, and there continued the fearful laugh
just as before.</p>
<p>Lord Mountclere became greatly frightened.&nbsp; The spot they had
reached was a green space within a girdle of hollies, and in front of
them rose an ornamental cottage.&nbsp; This was the building which Ethelberta
had visited earlier in the day: it was the Petit Trianon of Enckworth
Court.</p>
<p>The viscount left her side and hurried forward.&nbsp; The door of
the building was opened by a woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you prepared for us, as I directed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my lord; tea and coffee are both ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that now.&nbsp; Lady Mountclere is ill; come and
assist her indoors.&nbsp; Tell the other woman to bring wine and water
at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He returned to Ethelberta.&nbsp; She was better, and was sitting
calmly on the bank.&nbsp; She rose without assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may retire,&rsquo; he said to the woman who had followed
him, and she turned round.&nbsp; When Ethelberta saw the building, she
drew back quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the <i>other</i> Lady Mountclere?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She shall never return&mdash;never?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&nbsp; It was not intended that she should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That sounds well.&nbsp; Lord Mountclere, we may as well compromise
matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so too.&nbsp; It becomes a lady to make a virtue of
a necessity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was stratagem against stratagem.&nbsp; Mine was ingenious;
yours was masterly!&nbsp; Accept my acknowledgment.&nbsp; We will enter
upon an armed neutrality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Let me be your adorer and slave again, as ever.&nbsp;
Your beauty, dearest, covers everything!&nbsp; You are my mistress and
queen!&nbsp; But here we are at the door.&nbsp; Tea is prepared for
us here.&nbsp; I have a liking for life in this cottage mode, and live
here on occasion.&nbsp; Women, attend to Lady Mountclere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman who had seen Ethelberta in the morning was alarmed at recognizing
her, having since been informed officially of the marriage: she murmured
entreaties for pardon.&nbsp; They assisted the viscountess to a chair,
the door was closed, and the wind blew past as if nobody had ever stood
there to interrupt its flight.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Full of misgivings, Christopher continued to wait at the north gate.&nbsp;
Half-past seven had long since been past, and no Ethelberta had appeared.&nbsp;
He did not for the moment suppose the delay to be hers, and this gave
him patience; having taken up the position, he was induced by fidelity
to abide by the consequences.&nbsp; It would be only a journey of two
hours to reach Anglebury Station; he would ride outside with the driver,
put her into the train, and bid her adieu for ever.&nbsp; She had cried
for help, and he had heard her cry.</p>
<p>At last through the trees came the sound of the Court clock striking
eight, and then, for the first time, a doubt arose in his mind whether
she could have mistaken the gate.&nbsp; She had distinctly told Sol
the west lodge; her note had expressed the north lodge.&nbsp; Could
she by any accident have written one thing while meaning another?&nbsp;
He entered the carriage, and drove round to the west gate.&nbsp; All
was as silent there as at the other, the meeting between Ethelberta
and Lord Mountclere being then long past; and he drove back again.</p>
<p>He left the carriage, and entered the park on foot, approaching the
house slowly.&nbsp; All was silent; the windows were dark; moping sounds
came from the trees and sky, as from Sorrow whispering to Night.&nbsp;
By this time he felt assured that the scheme had miscarried.&nbsp; While
he stood here a carriage without lights came up the drive; it turned
in towards the stable-yard without going to the door.&nbsp; The carriage
had plainly been empty.</p>
<p>Returning across the grass by the way he had come, he was startled
by the voices of two men from the road hard by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have ye zeed anybody?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we go across again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good? let&rsquo;s home to supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord must have heard somebody, or &rsquo;a wouldn&rsquo;t
have said it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s nervous now he&rsquo;s living in the cottage
again.&nbsp; I thought that fancy was over.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m glad
&rsquo;tis a young wife he&rsquo;s brought us.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll have
her routs and her rackets as well as the high-born ones, you&rsquo;ll
see, as soon as she gets used to the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must be a queer Christian to pick up with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if she&rsquo;ve charity &rsquo;tis enough for we poor
men; her faith and hope may be as please God.&nbsp; Now I be for on-along
homeward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had gone Christopher moved from his hiding, and,
avoiding the gravel-walk, returned to his coachman, telling him to drive
at once to Anglebury.</p>
<p>Julian was so impatient of the futility of his adventure that he
wished to annihilate its existence.&nbsp; On reaching Anglebury he determined
to get on at once to Melchester, that the event of the night might be
summarily ended; to be still in the neighbourhood was to be still engaged
in it.&nbsp; He reached home before midnight.</p>
<p>Walking into their house in a quiet street, as dissatisfied with
himself as a man well could be who still retained health and an occupation,
he found Faith sitting up as usual.&nbsp; His news was simple: the marriage
had taken place before he could get there, and he had seen nothing of
either ceremony or viscountess.&nbsp; The remainder he reserved for
a more convenient season.</p>
<p>Edith looked anxiously at him as he ate supper, smiling now and then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am tired of this life,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Faith.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, if we were only
rich!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or if we were not rich,&rsquo; she said, turning her eyes
to the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we were only slightly provided for, it
would be better than nothing.&nbsp; How much would you be content with,
Kit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As much as I could get.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you be content with a thousand a year for both of us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I daresay I should,&rsquo; he murmured, breaking his bread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or five hundred for both?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or five hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or even three hundred?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bother three hundred.&nbsp; Less than double the sum would
not satisfy me.&nbsp; We may as well imagine much as little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith&rsquo;s countenance had fallen.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Kit,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;you always disappoint me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; How do I disappoint you this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By not caring for three hundred a year&mdash;a hundred and
fifty each&mdash;when that is all I have to offer you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith!&rsquo; said he, looking up for the first time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah&mdash;of course!&nbsp; Lucy&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; I had forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true, and I had prepared such a pleasant surprise for
you, and now you don&rsquo;t care!&nbsp; Our cousin Lucy did leave us
something after all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand the exact total
sum, but it comes to a hundred and fifty a year each&mdash;more than
I expected, though not so much as you deserved.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the
letter.&nbsp; I have been dwelling upon it all day, and thinking what
a pleasure it would be; and it is not after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, Faith, I was only supposing.&nbsp; The real
thing is another matter altogether.&nbsp; Well, the idea of Lucy&rsquo;s
will containing our names!&nbsp; I am sure I would have gone to the
funeral had I known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it were a thousand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.&nbsp; But, certainly,
three hundred for two is a tantalizing sum: not enough to enable us
to change our condition, and enough to make us dissatisfied with going
on as we are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must forget we have it, and let it increase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t enough to increase much.&nbsp; We may as well
use it.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; Take a bigger house&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the use?&nbsp; Give up the organ?&mdash;then I shall be rather worse
off than I am at present.&nbsp; Positively, it is the most provoking
amount anybody could have invented had they tried ever so long.&nbsp;
Poor Lucy, to do that, and not even to come near us when father died.
. . .&nbsp; Ah, I know what we&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go abroad&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
live in Italy.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>SEQUEL. ANGLEBURY&mdash;ENCKWORTH&mdash;SANDBOURNE</h2>
<p>Two years and a half after the marriage of Ethelberta and the evening
adventures which followed it, a man young in years, though considerably
older in mood and expression, walked up to the &lsquo;Red Lion&rsquo;
Inn at Anglebury.&nbsp; The anachronism sat not unbecomingly upon him,
and the voice was precisely that of the Christopher Julian of heretofore.&nbsp;
His way of entering the inn and calling for a conveyance was more off-hand
than formerly; he was much less afraid of the sound of his own voice
now than when he had gone through the same performance on a certain
chill evening the last time that he visited the spot.&nbsp; He wanted
to be taken to Knollsea to meet the steamer there, and was not coming
back by the same vehicle.</p>
<p>It was a very different day from that of his previous journey along
the same road; different in season; different in weather; and the humour
of the observer differed yet more widely from its condition then than
did the landscape from its former hues.&nbsp; In due time they reached
a commanding situation upon the road, from which were visible knots
and plantations of trees on the Enckworth manor.&nbsp; Christopher broke
the silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Mountclere is still alive and well, I am told?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O ay.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll live to be a hundred.&nbsp; Never
such a change as has come over the man of late years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, &rsquo;tis my lady.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a one to put up with!&nbsp;
Still, &rsquo;tis said here and there that marrying her was the best
day&rsquo;s work that he ever did in his life, although she&rsquo;s
got to be my lord and my lady both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she happy with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is very sharp with the pore man&mdash;about happy I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; He was a good-natured old man, for all his sins, and would
sooner any day lay out money in new presents than pay it in old debts.&nbsp;
But &rsquo;tis altered now.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t the same place.&nbsp;
Ah, in the old times I have seen the floor of the servants&rsquo; hall
over the vamp of your boot in solid beer that we had poured aside from
the horns because we couldn&rsquo;t see straight enough to pour it in.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; No, we couldn&rsquo;t see a hole in a ladder!&nbsp; And now,
even at Christmas or Whitsuntide, when a man, if ever he desires to
be overcome with a drop, would naturally wish it to be, you can walk
out of Enckworth as straight as you walked in.&nbsp; All her doings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she holds the reins?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She do!&nbsp; There was a little tussle at first; but how
could a old man hold his own against such a spry young body as that!&nbsp;
She threatened to run away from him, and kicked up Bob&rsquo;s-a-dying,
and I don&rsquo;t know what all; and being the woman, of course she
was sure to beat in the long run.&nbsp; Pore old nobleman, she marches
him off to church every Sunday as regular as a clock, makes him read
family prayers that haven&rsquo;t been read in Enckworth for the last
thirty years to my certain knowledge, and keeps him down to three glasses
of wine a day, strict, so that you never see him any the more generous
for liquor or a bit elevated at all, as it used to be.&nbsp; There,
&rsquo;tis true, it has done him good in one sense, for they say he&rsquo;d
have been dead in five years if he had gone on as he was going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that she&rsquo;s a good wife to him, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if she had been a little worse &rsquo;twould have been
a little better for him in one sense, for he would have had his own
way more.&nbsp; But he was a curious feller at one time, as we all know
and I suppose &rsquo;tis as much as he can expect; but &rsquo;tis a
strange reverse for him.&nbsp; It is said that when he&rsquo;s asked
out to dine, or to anything in the way of a jaunt, his eye flies across
to hers afore he answers: and if her eye says yes, he says yes: and
if her eye says no, he says no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a sad condition for
one who ruled womankind as he, that a woman should lead him in a string
whether he will or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sad indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s steward, and agent, and everything.&nbsp; She
has got a room called &ldquo;my lady&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; and great
ledgers and cash-books you never see the like.&nbsp; In old times there
were bailiffs to look after the workfolk, foremen to look after the
tradesmen, a building-steward to look after the foremen, a land-steward
to look after the building-steward, and a dashing grand agent to look
after the land-steward: fine times they had then, I assure ye.&nbsp;
My lady said they were eating out the property like a honeycomb, and
then there was a terrible row.&nbsp; Half of &rsquo;em were sent flying;
and now there&rsquo;s only the agent, and the viscountess, and a sort
of surveyor man, and of the three she does most work so &rsquo;tis said.&nbsp;
She marks the trees to be felled, settles what horses are to be sold
and bought, and is out in all winds and weathers.&nbsp; There, if somebody
hadn&rsquo;t looked into things &rsquo;twould soon have been all up
with his lordship, he was so very extravagant.&nbsp; In one sense &rsquo;twas
lucky for him that she was born in humble life, because owing to it
she knows the ins and outs of contriving, which he never did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then a man on the verge of bankruptcy will do better to marry
a poor and sensible wife than a rich and stupid one.&nbsp; Well, here
we are at the tenth milestone.&nbsp; I will walk the remainder of the
distance to Knollsea, as there is ample time for meeting the last steamboat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the man was gone Christopher proceeded slowly on foot down the
hill, and reached that part of the highway at which he had stopped in
the cold November breeze waiting for a woman who never came.&nbsp; He
was older now, and he had ceased to wish that he had not been disappointed.&nbsp;
There was the lodge, and around it were the trees, brilliant in the
shining greens of June.&nbsp; Every twig sustained its bird, and every
blossom its bee.&nbsp; The roadside was not muffled in a garment of
dead leaves as it had been then, and the lodge-gate was not open as
it always used to be.&nbsp; He paused to look through the bars.&nbsp;
The drive was well kept and gravelled; the grass edgings, formerly marked
by hoofs and ruts, and otherwise trodden away, were now green and luxuriant,
bent sticks being placed at intervals as a protection.</p>
<p>While he looked through the gate a woman stepped from the lodge to
open it.&nbsp; In her haste she nearly swung the gate into his face,
and would have completely done so had he not jumped back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rsquo; she said, on perceiving him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was going to open it for my lady, and I didn&rsquo;t see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher moved round the corner.&nbsp; The perpetual snubbing
that he had received from Ethelberta ever since he had known her seemed
about to be continued through the medium of her dependents.</p>
<p>A trotting, accompanied by the sound of light wheels, had become
perceptible; and then a vehicle came through the gate, and turned up
the road which he had come down.&nbsp; He saw the back of a basket carriage,
drawn by a pair of piebald ponies.&nbsp; A lad in livery sat behind
with folded arms; the driver was a lady.&nbsp; He saw her bonnet, her
shoulders, her hair&mdash;but no more.&nbsp; She lessened in his gaze,
and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>He stood a long time thinking; but he did not wish her his.</p>
<p>In this wholesome frame of mind he proceeded on his way, thankful
that he had escaped meeting her, though so narrowly.&nbsp; But perhaps
at this remote season the embarrassment of a rencounter would not have
been intense.&nbsp; At Knollsea he entered the steamer for Sandbourne.</p>
<p>Mr. Chickerel and his family now lived at Firtop Villa, in that place,
a house which, like many others, had been built since Julian&rsquo;s
last visit to the town.&nbsp; He was directed to the outskirts, and
into a fir plantation where drives and intersecting roads had been laid
out, and where new villas had sprung up like mushrooms.&nbsp; He entered
by a swing gate, on which &lsquo;Firtop&rsquo; was painted, and a maid-servant
showed him into a neatly-furnished room, containing Mr. Chickerel, Mrs.
Chickerel, and Picotee, the matron being reclined on a couch, which
improved health had permitted her to substitute for a bed.</p>
<p>He had been expected, and all were glad to see again the sojourner
in foreign lands, even down to the ladylike tabby, who was all purr
and warmth towards him except when she was all claws and nippers.&nbsp;
But had the prime sentiment of the meeting shown itself it would have
been the unqualified surprise of Christopher at seeing how much Picotee&rsquo;s
face had grown to resemble her sister&rsquo;s: it was less a resemblance
in contours than in expression and tone.</p>
<p>They had an early tea, and then Mr. Chickerel, sitting in a patriarchal
chair, conversed pleasantly with his guest, being well acquainted with
him through other members of the family.&nbsp; They talked of Julian&rsquo;s
residence at different Italian towns with his sister; of Faith, who
was at the present moment staying with some old friends in Melchester:
and, as was inevitable, the discourse hovered over and settled upon
Ethelberta, the prime ruler of the courses of them all, with little
exception, through recent years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a hard struggle for her,&rsquo; said Chickerel, looking
reflectively out at the fir trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never thought the
girl would have got through it.&nbsp; When she first entered the house
everybody was against her.&nbsp; She had to fight a whole host of them
single-handed.&nbsp; There was the viscount&rsquo;s brother, other relations,
lawyers, ladies, servants, not one of them was her friend; and not one
who wouldn&rsquo;t rather have seen her arrive there in evil relationship
with him than as she did come.&nbsp; But she stood her ground.&nbsp;
She was put upon her mettle; and one by one they got to feel there was
somebody among them whose little finger, if they insulted her, was thicker
than a Mountclere&rsquo;s loins.&nbsp; She must have had a will of iron;
it was a situation that would have broken the hearts of a dozen ordinary
women, for everybody soon knew that we were of no family, and that&rsquo;s
what made it so hard for her.&nbsp; But there she is as mistress now,
and everybody respecting her.&nbsp; I sometimes fancy she is occasionally
too severe with the servants and I know what service is.&nbsp; But she
says it is necessary, owing to her birth; and perhaps she is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose she often comes to see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four or five times a year,&rsquo; said Picotee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She cannot come quite so often as she would,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Chickerel, &lsquo;because of her lofty position, which has its juties.&nbsp;
Well, as I always say, Berta doesn&rsquo;t take after me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
have married the man even though he did bring a coronet with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have cared to let him ask ye,&rsquo; said
Chickerel.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there&mdash;all
ended better than I expected.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s fond of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it is wonderful what can be done with an old man when
you are his darling,&rsquo; said Mrs. Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were Berta I should go to London oftener,&rsquo; said
Picotee, to turn the conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;But she lives mostly
in the library.&nbsp; And, O, what do you think?&nbsp; She is writing
an epic poem, and employs Emmeline as her reader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me.&nbsp; And how are Sol and Dan?&nbsp; You mentioned
them once in your letters,&rsquo; said Christopher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta has set them up as builders in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She bought a business for them,&rsquo; said Chickerel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But Sol wouldn&rsquo;t accept her help for a long time, and now
he has only agreed to it on condition of paying her back the money with
interest, which he is doing.&nbsp; They have just signed a contract
to build a hospital for twenty thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee broke in&mdash;&lsquo;You knew that both Gwendoline and Cornelia
married two years ago, and went to Queensland?&nbsp; They married two
brothers, who were farmers, and left England the following week.&nbsp;
Georgie and Myrtle are at school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Joey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are thinking of making Joseph a parson,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Chickerel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! a parson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; &rsquo;tis a genteel living for the boy.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s
talents that way.&nbsp; Since he has been under masters he knows all
the strange sounds the old Romans and Greeks used to make by way of
talking, and the love stories of the ancient women as if they were his
own.&nbsp; I assure you, Mr. Julian, if you could hear how beautiful
the boy tells about little Cupid with his bow and arrows, and the rows
between that pagan apostle Jupiter and his wife because of another woman,
and the handsome young gods who kissed Venus, you&rsquo;d say he deserved
to be made a bishop at once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The evening advanced, and they walked in the garden.&nbsp; Here,
by some means, Picotee and Christopher found themselves alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your letters to my sister have been charming,&rsquo; said
Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;And so regular, too.&nbsp; It was as good
as a birthday every time one arrived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Picotee blushed and said nothing.</p>
<p>Christopher had full assurance that her heart was where it always
had been.&nbsp; A suspicion of the fact had been the reason of his visit
here to-day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Other letters were once written from England to Italy, and
they acquired great celebrity.&nbsp; Do you know whose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Walpole&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said Picotee timidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but they never charmed me half as much as yours.&nbsp;
You may rest assured that one person in the world thinks Walpole your
second.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have read them; they were not written to you.&nbsp;
But I suppose you wished to hear of Ethelberta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first I did,&rsquo; said Christopher.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,
oddly enough, I got more interested in the writer than in her news.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know if ever before there has been an instance of loving
by means of letters.&nbsp; If not, it is because there have never been
such sweet ones written.&nbsp; At last I looked for them more anxiously
than Faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, you knew me before.&rsquo;&nbsp; Picotee would have
withdrawn this remark if she could, fearing that it seemed like a suggestion
of her love long ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, on my return, I thought I would just call and see you,
and go away and think what would be best for me to do with a view to
the future.&nbsp; But since I have been here I have felt that I could
not go away to think without first asking you what you think on one
point&mdash;whether you could ever marry me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would ask that when I first saw you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you.&nbsp; Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You looked at me as if you would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued Christopher, &lsquo;the worst of it
is I am as poor as Job.&nbsp; Faith and I have three hundred a year
between us, but only half is mine.&nbsp; So that before I get your promise
I must let your father know how poor I am.&nbsp; Besides what I mention,
I have only my earnings by music.&nbsp; But I am to be installed as
chief organist at Melchester soon, instead of deputy, as I used to be;
which is something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am to have five hundred pounds when I marry.&nbsp; That
was Lord Mountclere&rsquo;s arrangement with Ethelberta.&nbsp; He is
extremely anxious that I should marry well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate.&nbsp; A marriage with me will hardly
be considered well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, it will,&rsquo; said Picotee quickly, and then looked
frightened.</p>
<p>Christopher drew her towards him, and imprinted a kiss upon her cheek,
at which Picotee was not so wretched as she had been some years before
when he mistook her for another in that performance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Berta will never let us come to want,&rsquo; she said, with
vivacity, when she had recovered.&nbsp; &lsquo;She always gives me what
is necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will endeavour not to trouble her,&rsquo; said Christopher,
amused by Picotee&rsquo;s utter dependence now as ever upon her sister,
as upon an eternal Providence.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, it is well to be
kin to a coach though you never ride in it.&nbsp; Now, shall we go indoors
to your father?&nbsp; You think he will not object?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he will be very glad,&rsquo; replied Picotee.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Berta will, I know.&rsquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
