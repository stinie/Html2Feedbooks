<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
<p>I reprint in this volume, for what they may be worth, a dozen minor
novels that have been published in the periodical press at various dates
in the past, in order to render them accessible to readers who desire
to have them in the complete series issued by my publishers.&nbsp; For
aid in reclaiming some of the narratives I express my thanks to the
proprietors and editors of the newspapers and magazines in whose pages
they first appeared.</p>

<h2>A CHANGED MAN</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The person who, next to the actors themselves, chanced to know most
of their story, lived just below &lsquo;Top o&rsquo; Town&rsquo; (as
the spot was called) in an old substantially-built house, distinguished
among its neighbours by having an oriel window on the first floor, whence
could be obtained a raking view of the High Street, west and east, the
former including Laura&rsquo;s dwelling, the end of the Town Avenue
hard by (in which were played the odd pranks hereafter to be mentioned),
the Port-Bredy road rising westwards, and the turning that led to the
cavalry barracks where the Captain was quartered.&nbsp; Looking eastward
down the town from the same favoured gazebo, the long perspective of
houses declined and dwindled till they merged in the highway across
the moor.&nbsp; The white riband of road disappeared over Grey&rsquo;s
Bridge a quarter of a mile off, to plunge into innumerable rustic windings,
shy shades, and solitary undulations up hill and down dale for one hundred
and twenty miles till it exhibited itself at Hyde Park Corner as a smooth
bland surface in touch with a busy and fashionable world.</p>
<p>To the barracks aforesaid had recently arrived the ---th Hussars,
a regiment new to the locality.&nbsp; Almost before any acquaintance
with its members had been made by the townspeople, a report spread that
they were a &lsquo;crack&rsquo; body of men, and had brought a splendid
band.&nbsp; For some reason or other the town had not been used as the
headquarters of cavalry for many years, the various troops stationed
there having consisted of casual detachments only; so that it was with
a sense of honour that everybody&mdash;even the small furniture-broker
from whom the married troopers hired tables and chairs&mdash;received
the news of their crack quality.</p>
<p>In those days the Hussar regiments still wore over the left shoulder
that attractive attachment, or frilled half-coat, hanging loosely behind
like the wounded wing of a bird, which was called the pelisse, though
it was known among the troopers themselves as a &lsquo;sling-jacket.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It added amazingly to their picturesqueness in women&rsquo;s eyes, and,
indeed, in the eyes of men also.</p>
<p>The burgher who lived in the house with the oriel window sat during
a great many hours of the day in that projection, for he was an invalid,
and time hung heavily on his hands unless he maintained a constant interest
in proceedings without.&nbsp; Not more than a week after the arrival
of the Hussars his ears were assailed by the shout of one schoolboy
to another in the street below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have &rsquo;ee heard this about the Hussars?&nbsp; They are
haunted!&nbsp; Yes&mdash;a ghost troubles &rsquo;em; he has followed
&rsquo;em about the world for years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A haunted regiment: that was a new idea for either invalid or stalwart.&nbsp;
The listener in the oriel came to the conclusion that there were some
lively characters among the ---th Hussars.</p>
<p>He made Captain Maumbry&rsquo;s acquaintance in an informal manner
at an afternoon tea to which he went in a wheeled chair&mdash;one of
the very rare outings that the state of his health permitted.&nbsp;
Maumbry showed himself to be a handsome man of twenty-eight or thirty,
with an attractive hint of wickedness in his manner that was sure to
make him adorable with good young women.&nbsp; The large dark eyes that
lit his pale face expressed this wickedness strongly, though such was
the adaptability of their rays that one could think they might have
expressed sadness or seriousness just as readily, if he had had a mind
for such.</p>
<p>An old and deaf lady who was present asked Captain Maumbry bluntly:
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this we hear about you?&nbsp; They say your regiment
is haunted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s face assumed an aspect of grave, even sad, concern.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;it is too true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some younger ladies smiled till they saw how serious he looked, when
they looked serious likewise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo; said the old lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; We naturally don&rsquo;t wish to say much about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; of course not.&nbsp; But&mdash;how haunted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; the&mdash;<i>thing</i>, as I&rsquo;ll call it, follows
us.&nbsp; In country quarters or town, abroad or at home, it&rsquo;s
just the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you account for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maumbry lowered his voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some
crime committed by certain of our regiment in past years, we suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me . . . How very horrid, and singular!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, as I said, we don&rsquo;t speak of it much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No . . . no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Hussar was gone, a young lady, disclosing a long-suppressed
interest, asked if the ghost had been seen by any of the town.</p>
<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s son, who always had the latest borough news, said
that, though it was seldom seen by any one but the Hussars themselves,
more than one townsman and woman had already set eyes on it, to his
or her terror.&nbsp; The phantom mostly appeared very late at night,
under the dense trees of the town-avenue nearest the barracks.&nbsp;
It was about ten feet high; its teeth chattered with a dry naked sound,
as if they were those of a skeleton; and its hip-bones could be heard
grating in their sockets.</p>
<p>During the darkest weeks of winter several timid persons were seriously
frightened by the object answering to this cheerful description, and
the police began to look into the matter.&nbsp; Whereupon the appearances
grew less frequent, and some of the Boys of the regiment thankfully
stated that they had not been so free from ghostly visitation for years
as they had become since their arrival in Casterbridge.</p>
<p>This playing at ghosts was the most innocent of the amusements indulged
in by the choice young spirits who inhabited the lichened, red-brick
building at the top of the town bearing &lsquo;W.D.&rsquo; and a broad
arrow on its quoins.&nbsp; Far more serious escapades&mdash;levities
relating to love, wine, cards, betting&mdash;were talked of, with no
doubt more or less of exaggeration.&nbsp; That the Hussars, Captain
Maumbry included, were the cause of bitter tears to several young women
of the town and country is unquestionably true, despite the fact that
the gaieties of the young men wore a more staring colour in this old-fashioned
place than they would have done in a large and modern city.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Regularly once a week they rode out in marching order.</p>
<p>Returning up the town on one of these occasions, the romantic pelisse
flapping behind each horseman&rsquo;s shoulder in the soft south-west
wind, Captain Maumbry glanced up at the oriel.&nbsp; A mutual nod was
exchanged between him and the person who sat there reading.&nbsp; The
reader and a friend in the room with him followed the troop with their
eyes all the way up the street, till, when the soldiers were opposite
the house in which Laura lived, that young lady became discernible in
the balcony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are engaged to be married, I hear,&rsquo; said the friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&mdash;Maumbry and Laura?&nbsp; Never&mdash;so soon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never marry.&nbsp; Several girls have been mentioned
in connection with his name.&nbsp; I am sorry for Laura.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but you needn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; They are excellently matched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s only one more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s one more, and more still.&nbsp; She has regularly
caught him.&nbsp; She is a born player of the game of hearts, and she
knew how to beat him in his own practices.&nbsp; If there is one woman
in the town who has any chance of holding her own and marrying him,
she is that woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was true, as it turned out.&nbsp; By natural proclivity Laura
had from the first entered heart and soul into military romance as exhibited
in the plots and characters of those living exponents of it who came
under her notice.&nbsp; From her earliest young womanhood civilians,
however promising, had no chance of winning her interest if the meanest
warrior were within the horizon.&nbsp; It may be that the position of
her uncle&rsquo;s house (which was her home) at the corner of West Street
nearest the barracks, the daily passing of the troops, the constant
blowing of trumpet-calls a furlong from her windows, coupled with the
fact that she knew nothing of the inner realities of military life,
and hence idealized it, had also helped her mind&rsquo;s original bias
for thinking men-at-arms the only ones worthy of a woman&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Captain Maumbry was a typical prize; one whom all surrounding maidens
had coveted, ached for, angled for, wept for, had by her judicious management
become subdued to her purpose; and in addition to the pleasure of marrying
the man she loved, Laura had the joy of feeling herself hated by the
mothers of all the marriageable girls of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The man in the oriel went to the wedding; not as a guest, for at
this time he was but slightly acquainted with the parties; but mainly
because the church was close to his house; partly, too, for a reason
which moved many others to be spectators of the ceremony; a subconsciousness
that, though the couple might be happy in their experiences, there was
sufficient possibility of their being otherwise to colour the musings
of an onlooker with a pleasing pathos of conjecture.&nbsp; He could
on occasion do a pretty stroke of rhyming in those days, and he beguiled
the time of waiting by pencilling on a blank page of his prayer-book
a few lines which, though kept private then, may be given here:-</p>
<blockquote><p>AT A HASTY WEDDING</p>
<p>(Triolet)</p>
<p>If hours be years the twain are blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For now they solace swift desire<br />
By lifelong ties that tether zest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If hours be years.&nbsp; The twain are blest<br />
Do eastern suns slope never west,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor pallid ashes follow fire.<br />
If hours be years the twain are blest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For now they solace swift desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if, however, to falsify all prophecies, the couple seemed to find
in marriage the secret of perpetuating the intoxication of a courtship
which, on Maumbry&rsquo;s side at least, had opened without serious
intent.&nbsp; During the winter following they were the most popular
pair in and about Casterbridge&mdash;nay in South Wessex itself.&nbsp;
No smart dinner in the country houses of the younger and gayer families
within driving distance of the borough was complete without their lively
presence; Mrs. Maumbry was the blithest of the whirling figures at the
county ball; and when followed that inevitable incident of garrison-town
life, an amateur dramatic entertainment, it was just the same.&nbsp;
The acting was for the benefit of such and such an excellent charity&mdash;nobody
cared what, provided the play were played&mdash;and both Captain Maumbry
and his wife were in the piece, having been in fact, by mutual consent,
the originators of the performance.&nbsp; And so with laughter, and
thoughtlessness, and movement, all went merrily.&nbsp; There was a little
backwardness in the bill-paying of the couple; but in justice to them
it must be added that sooner or later all owings were paid.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>At the chapel-of-ease attended by the troops there arose above the
edge of the pulpit one Sunday an unknown face.&nbsp; This was the face
of a new curate.&nbsp; He placed upon the desk, not the familiar sermon
book, but merely a Bible.&nbsp; The person who tells these things was
not present at that service, but he soon learnt that the young curate
was nothing less than a great surprise to his congregation; a mixed
one always, for though the Hussars occupied the body of the building,
its nooks and corners were crammed with civilians, whom, up to the present,
even the least uncharitable would have described as being attracted
thither less by the services than by the soldiery.</p>
<p>Now there arose a second reason for squeezing into an already overcrowded
church.&nbsp; The persuasive and gentle eloquence of Mr. Sainway operated
like a charm upon those accustomed only to the higher and dryer styles
of preaching, and for a time the other churches of the town were thinned
of their sitters.</p>
<p>At this point in the nineteenth century the sermon was the sole reason
for churchgoing amongst a vast body of religious people.&nbsp; The liturgy
was a formal preliminary, which, like the Royal proclamation in a court
of assize, had to be got through before the real interest began; and
on reaching home the question was simply: Who preached, and how did
he handle his subject?&nbsp; Even had an archbishop officiated in the
service proper nobody would have cared much about what was said or sung.&nbsp;
People who had formerly attended in the morning only began to go in
the evening, and even to the special addresses in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One day when Captain Maumbry entered his wife&rsquo;s drawing-room,
filled with hired furniture, she thought he was somebody else, for he
had not come upstairs humming the most catching air afloat in musical
circles or in his usual careless way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jack?&rsquo; she said without looking
up from a note she was writing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;not much, that I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, but there is,&rsquo; she murmured as she wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;this cursed new lath in a sheet&mdash;I mean the
new parson!&nbsp; He wants us to stop the band-playing on Sunday afternoons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura looked up aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it is the one thing that enables the few rational beings
hereabouts to keep alive from Saturday to Monday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says all the town flock to the music and don&rsquo;t come
to the service, and that the pieces played are profane, or mundane,
or inane, or something&mdash;not what ought to be played on Sunday.&nbsp;
Of course &rsquo;tis Lautmann who settles those things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lautmann was the bandmaster.</p>
<p>The barrack-green on Sunday afternoons had, indeed, become the promenade
of a great many townspeople cheerfully inclined, many even of those
who attended in the morning at Mr. Sainway&rsquo;s service; and little
boys who ought to have been listening to the curate&rsquo;s afternoon
lecture were too often seen rolling upon the grass and making faces
behind the more dignified listeners.</p>
<p>Laura heard no more about the matter, however, for two or three weeks,
when suddenly remembering it she asked her husband if any further objections
had been raised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;Mr. Sainway.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
made his acquaintance.&nbsp; He is not a bad sort of man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura asked if either Maumbry or some others of the officers did
not give the presumptuous curate a good setting down for his interference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O well&mdash;we&rsquo;ve forgotten that.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
a stunning preacher, they tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The acquaintance developed apparently, for the Captain said to her
a little later on, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal in Sainway&rsquo;s
argument about having no band on Sunday afternoons.&nbsp; After all,
it is close to his church.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t press his objections
unduly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am surprised to hear you defend him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was only a passing thought of mine.&nbsp; We naturally
don&rsquo;t wish to offend the inhabitants of the town if they don&rsquo;t
like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The invalid in the oriel never clearly gathered the details of progress
in this conflict of lay and clerical opinion; but so it was that, to
the disappointment of musicians, the grief of out-walking lovers, and
the regret of the junior population of the town and country round, the
band-playing on Sunday afternoons ceased in Casterbridge barrack-square.</p>
<p>By this time the Maumbrys had frequently listened to the preaching
of the gentle if narrow-minded curate; for these light-natured, hit-or-miss,
rackety people went to church like others for respectability&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; None so orthodox as your unmitigated worldling.&nbsp; A
more remarkable event was the sight to the man in the window of Captain
Maumbry and Mr. Sainway walking down the High Street in earnest conversation.&nbsp;
On his mentioning this fact to a caller he was assured that it was a
matter of common talk that they were always together.</p>
<p>The observer would soon have learnt this with his own eyes if he
had not been told.&nbsp; They began to pass together nearly every day.&nbsp;
Hitherto Mrs. Maumbry, in fashionable walking clothes, had usually been
her husband&rsquo;s companion; but this was less frequent now.&nbsp;
The close and singular friendship between the two men went on for nearly
a year, when Mr. Sainway was presented to a living in a densely-populated
town in the midland counties.&nbsp; He bade the parishioners of his
old place a reluctant farewell and departed, the touching sermon he
preached on the occasion being published by the local printer.&nbsp;
Everybody was sorry to lose him; and it was with genuine grief that
his Casterbridge congregation learnt later on that soon after his induction
to his benefice, during some bitter weather, he had fallen seriously
ill of inflammation of the lungs, of which he eventually died.</p>
<p>We now get below the surface of things.&nbsp; Of all who had known
the dead curate, none grieved for him like the man who on his first
arrival had called him a &lsquo;lath in a sheet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Maumbry
had never greatly sympathized with the impressive parson; indeed, she
had been secretly glad that he had gone away to better himself.&nbsp;
He had considerably diminished the pleasures of a woman by whom the
joys of earth and good company had been appreciated to the full.&nbsp;
Sorry for her husband in his loss of a friend who had been none of hers,
she was yet quite unprepared for the sequel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something that I have wanted to tell you lately,
dear,&rsquo; he said one morning at breakfast with hesitation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you guessed what it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had guessed nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I think of retiring from the army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought more and more of Sainway since his death, and
of what he used to say to me so earnestly.&nbsp; And I feel certain
I shall be right in obeying a call within me to give up this fighting
trade and enter the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;be a parson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what should <i>I</i> do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be a parson&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; she affirmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how can you help it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll run away rather!&rsquo; she said vehemently;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Maumbry replied, in the tone
he used when his mind was made up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get accustomed
to the idea, for I am constrained to carry it out, though it is against
my worldly interests.&nbsp; I am forced on by a Hand outside me to tread
in the steps of Sainway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; she asked, with calm pallor and round eyes; &lsquo;do
you mean to say seriously that you are arranging to be a curate instead
of a soldier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might say a curate <i>is</i> a soldier&mdash;of the church
militant; but I don&rsquo;t want to offend you with doctrine.&nbsp;
I distinctly say, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Late one evening, a little time onward, he caught her sitting by
the dim firelight in her room.&nbsp; She did not know he had entered;
and he found her weeping.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you crying about, poor
dearest?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She started.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because of what you have told me!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Captain grew very unhappy; but he was undeterred.</p>
<p>In due time the town learnt, to its intense surprise, that Captain
Maumbry had retired from the ---th Hussars and gone to Fountall Theological
College to prepare for the ministry.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>&lsquo;O, the pity of it!&nbsp; Such a dashing soldier&mdash;so popular&mdash;such
an acquisition to the town&mdash;the soul of social life here!&nbsp;
And now! . . . One should not speak ill of the dead, but that dreadful
Mr. Sainway&mdash;it was too cruel of him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a summary of what was said when Captain, now the Reverend,
John Maumbry was enabled by circumstances to indulge his heart&rsquo;s
desire of returning to the scene of his former exploits in the capacity
of a minister of the Gospel.&nbsp; A low-lying district of the town,
which at that date was crowded with impoverished cottagers, was crying
for a curate, and Mr. Maumbry generously offered himself as one willing
to undertake labours that were certain to produce little result, and
no thanks, credit, or emolument.</p>
<p>Let the truth be told about him as a clergyman; he proved to be anything
but a brilliant success.&nbsp; Painstaking, single-minded, deeply in
earnest as all could see, his delivery was laboured, his sermons were
dull to listen to, and alas, too, too long.&nbsp; Even the dispassionate
judges who sat by the hour in the bar-parlour of the White Hart&mdash;an
inn standing at the dividing line between the poor quarter aforesaid
and the fashionable quarter of Maumbry&rsquo;s former triumphs, and
hence affording a position of strict impartiality&mdash;agreed in substance
with the young ladies to the westward, though their views were somewhat
more tersely expressed: &lsquo;Surely, God A&rsquo;mighty spwiled a
good sojer to make a bad pa&rsquo;son when He shifted Cap&rsquo;n Ma&rsquo;mbry
into a sarpless!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter knew that such things were said, but he pursued his daily&rsquo;
labours in and out of the hovels with serene unconcern.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the invalid in the oriel became more
than a mere bowing acquaintance of Mrs. Maumbry&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She had
returned to the town with her husband, and was living with him in a
little house in the centre of his circle of ministration, when by some
means she became one of the invalid&rsquo;s visitors.&nbsp; After a
general conversation while sitting in his room with a friend of both,
an incident led up to the matter that still rankled deeply in her soul.&nbsp;
Her face was now paler and thinner than it had been; even more attractive,
her disappointments having inscribed themselves as meek thoughtfulness
on a look that was once a little frivolous.&nbsp; The two ladies had
called to be allowed to use the window for observing the departure of
the Hussars, who were leaving for barracks much nearer to London.</p>
<p>The troopers turned the corner of Barrack Road into the top of High
Street, headed by their band playing &lsquo;The girl I left behind me&rsquo;
(which was formerly always the tune for such times, though it is now
nearly disused).&nbsp; They came and passed the oriel, where an officer
or two, looking up and discovering Mrs. Maumbry, saluted her, whose
eyes filled with tears as the notes of the band waned away.&nbsp; Before
the little group had recovered from that sense of the romantic which
such spectacles impart, Mr. Maumbry came along the pavement.&nbsp; He
probably had bidden his former brethren-in-arms a farewell at the top
of the street, for he walked from that direction in his rather shabby
clerical clothes, and with a basket on his arm which seemed to hold
some purchases he had been making for his poorer parishioners.&nbsp;
Unlike the soldiers he went along quite unconscious of his appearance
or of the scene around.</p>
<p>The contrast was too much for Laura.&nbsp; With lips that now quivered,
she asked the invalid what he thought of the change that had come to
her.</p>
<p>It was difficult to answer, and with a wilfulness that was too strong
in her she repeated the question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that a woman&rsquo;s
husband has a right to do such a thing, even if he does feel a certain
call to it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her listener sympathized too largely with both of them to be anything
but unsatisfactory in his reply.&nbsp; Laura gazed longingly out of
the window towards the thin dusty line of Hussars, now smalling towards
the Mellstock Ridge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;who should
have been in their van on the way to London, am doomed to fester in
a hole in Durnover Lane!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many events had passed and many rumours had been current concerning
her before the invalid saw her again after her leave-taking that day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Casterbridge had known many military and civil episodes; many happy
times, and times less happy; and now came the time of her visitation.&nbsp;
The scourge of cholera had been laid on the suffering country, and the
low-lying purlieus of this ancient borough had more than their share
of the infliction.&nbsp; Mixen Lane, in the Durnover quarter, and in
Maumbry&rsquo;s parish, was where the blow fell most heavily.&nbsp;
Yet there was a certain mercy in its choice of a date, for Maumbry was
the man for such an hour.</p>
<p>The spread of the epidemic was so rapid that many left the town and
took lodgings in the villages and farms.&nbsp; Mr. Maumbry&rsquo;s house
was close to the most infected street, and he himself was occupied morn,
noon, and night in endeavours to stamp out the plague and in alleviating
the sufferings of the victims.&nbsp; So, as a matter of ordinary precaution,
he decided to isolate his wife somewhere away from him for a while.</p>
<p>She suggested a village by the sea, near Budmouth Regis, and lodgings
were obtained for her at Creston, a spot divided from the Casterbridge
valley by a high ridge that gave it quite another atmosphere, though
it lay no more than six miles off.</p>
<p>Thither she went.&nbsp; While she was rusticating in this place of
safety, and her husband was slaving in the slums, she struck up an acquaintance
with a lieutenant in the ---st Foot, a Mr. Vannicock, who was stationed
with his regiment at the Budmouth infantry barracks.&nbsp; As Laura
frequently sat on the shelving beach, watching each thin wave slide
up to her, and hearing, without heeding, its gnaw at the pebbles in
its retreat, he often took a walk that way.</p>
<p>The acquaintance grew and ripened.&nbsp; Her situation, her history,
her beauty, her age&mdash;a year or two above his own&mdash;all tended
to make an impression on the young man&rsquo;s heart, and a reckless
flirtation was soon in blithe progress upon that lonely shore.</p>
<p>It was said by her detractors afterwards that she had chosen her
lodging to be near this gentleman, but there is reason to believe that
she had never seen him till her arrival there.&nbsp; Just now Casterbridge
was so deeply occupied with its own sad affairs&mdash;a daily burying
of the dead and destruction of contaminated clothes and bedding&mdash;that
it had little inclination to promulgate such gossip as may have reached
its ears on the pair.&nbsp; Nobody long considered Laura in the tragic
cloud which overhung all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Budmouth side of the hill the very mood of men
was in contrast.&nbsp; The visitation there had been slight and much
earlier, and normal occupations and pastimes had been resumed.&nbsp;
Mr. Maumbry had arranged to see Laura twice a week in the open air,
that she might run no risk from him; and, having heard nothing of the
faint rumour, he met her as usual one dry and windy afternoon on the
summit of the dividing hill, near where the high road from town to town
crosses the old Ridge-way at right angles.</p>
<p>He waved his hand, and smiled as she approached, shouting to her:
&lsquo;We will keep this wall between us, dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Walls
formed the field-fences here.)&nbsp; &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be endangered.&nbsp;
It won&rsquo;t be for long, with God&rsquo;s help!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do as you tell me, Jack.&nbsp; But you are running
too much risk yourself, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I get little news of
you; but I fancy you are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not more than others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus somewhat formally they talked, an insulating wind beating the
wall between them like a mill-weir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you wanted to ask me something?&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; You know we are trying in Budmouth to raise some
money for your sufferers; and the way we have thought of is by a dramatic
performance.&nbsp; They want me to take a part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His face saddened.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have known so much of that sort
of thing, and all that accompanies it!&nbsp; I wish you had thought
of some other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said lightly that she was afraid it was all settled.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
object to my taking a part, then?&nbsp; Of course&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told her that he did not like to say he positively objected.&nbsp;
He wished they had chosen an oratorio, or lecture, or anything more
in keeping with the necessity it was to relieve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said she impatiently, &lsquo;people won&rsquo;t
come to oratorios or lectures!&nbsp; They will crowd to comedies and
farces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I cannot dictate to Budmouth how it shall earn the money
it is going to give us.&nbsp; Who is getting up this performance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The boys of the ---st.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes; our old game!&rsquo; replied Mr. Maumbry.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
grief of Casterbridge is the excuse for their frivolity.&nbsp; Candidly,
dear Laura, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t play in it.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
forbid you to.&nbsp; I leave the whole to your judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The interview ended, and they went their ways northward and southward.&nbsp;
Time disclosed to all concerned that Mrs. Maumbry played in the comedy
as the heroine, the lover&rsquo;s part being taken by Mr. Vannicock.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>Thus was helped on an event which the conduct of the mutually-attracted
ones had been generating for some time.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to give details.&nbsp; The ---st Foot left for
Bristol, and this precipitated their action.&nbsp; After a week of hesitation
she agreed to leave her home at Creston and meet Vannicock on the ridge
hard by, and to accompany him to Bath, where he had secured lodgings
for her, so that she would be only about a dozen miles from his quarters.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the evening chosen, she laid on her dressing-table
a note for her husband, running thus:-</p>
<blockquote><p>DEAR JACK&mdash;I am unable to endure this life any longer,
and I have resolved to put an end to it.&nbsp; I told you I should run
away if you persisted in being a clergyman, and now I am doing it.&nbsp;
One cannot help one&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; I have resolved to throw in
my lot with Mr. Vannicock, and I hope rather than expect you will forgive
me.&mdash;L.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, with hardly a scrap of luggage, she went, ascending to the
ridge in the dusk of early evening.&nbsp; Almost on the very spot where
her husband had stood at their last tryst she beheld the outline of
Vannicock, who had come all the way from Bristol to fetch her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like meeting here&mdash;it is so unlucky!&rsquo;
she cried to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let us have a place
of our own.&nbsp; Go back to the milestone, and I&rsquo;ll come on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the milestone that stands on the north slope of the
ridge, where the old and new roads diverge, and she joined him there.</p>
<p>She was taciturn and sorrowful when he asked her why she would not
meet him on the top.&nbsp; At last she inquired how they were going
to travel.</p>
<p>He explained that he proposed to walk to Mellstock Hill, on the other
side of Casterbridge, where a fly was waiting to take them by a cross-cut
into the Ivell Road, and onward to that town.&nbsp; The Bristol railway
was open to Ivell.</p>
<p>This plan they followed, and walked briskly through the dull gloom
till they neared Casterbridge, which place they avoided by turning to
the right at the Roman Amphitheatre and bearing round to Durnover Cross.&nbsp;
Thence the way was solitary and open across the moor to the hill whereon
the Ivell fly awaited them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have noticed for some time,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;a lurid
glare over the Durnover end of the town.&nbsp; It seems to come from
somewhere about Mixen Lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lamps,&rsquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a lamp as big as a rushlight in the whole
lane.&nbsp; It is where the cholera is worst.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By Standfast Corner, a little beyond the Cross, they suddenly obtained
an end view of the lane.&nbsp; Large bonfires were burning in the middle
of the way, with a view to purifying the air; and from the wretched
tenements with which the lane was lined in those days persons were bringing
out bedding and clothing.&nbsp; Some was thrown into the fires, the
rest placed in wheel-barrows and wheeled into the moor directly in the
track of the fugitives.</p>
<p>They followed on, and came up to where a vast copper was set in the
open air.&nbsp; Here the linen was boiled and disinfected.&nbsp; By
the light of the lanterns Laura discovered that her husband was standing
by the copper, and that it was he who unloaded the barrow and immersed
its contents.&nbsp; The night was so calm and muggy that the conversation
by the copper reached her ears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there many more loads to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the clothes o&rsquo; they that died this afternoon,
sir.&nbsp; But that might bide till to-morrow, for you must be tired
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do it at once, for I can&rsquo;t ask anybody else
to undertake it.&nbsp; Overturn that load on the grass and fetch the
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man did so and went off with the barrow.&nbsp; Maumbry paused
for a moment to wipe his face, and resumed his homely drudgery amid
this squalid and reeking scene, pressing down and stirring the contents
of the copper with what looked like an old rolling-pin.&nbsp; The steam
therefrom, laden with death, travelled in a low trail across the meadow.</p>
<p>Laura spoke suddenly: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go to-night after all.&nbsp;
He is so tired, and I must help him.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know things
were so bad as this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vannicock&rsquo;s arm dropped from her waist, where it had been resting
as they walked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you leave?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will if you say I must.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d rather help
too.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was no expostulation in his tone.</p>
<p>Laura had gone forward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I
am come to help!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The weary curate turned and held up the lantern.&nbsp; &lsquo;O&mdash;what,
is it you, Laura?&rsquo; he asked in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did
you come into this?&nbsp; You had better go back&mdash;the risk is great.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I want to help you, Jack.&nbsp; Please let me help!&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t come by myself&mdash;Mr. Vannicock kept me company.&nbsp;
He will make himself useful too, if he&rsquo;s not gone on.&nbsp; Mr.
Vannicock!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young lieutenant came forward reluctantly.&nbsp; Mr. Maumbry
spoke formally to him, adding as he resumed his labour, &lsquo;I thought
the ---st Foot had gone to Bristol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have.&nbsp; But I have run down again for a few things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two newcomers began to assist, Vannicock placing on the ground
the small bag containing Laura&rsquo;s toilet articles that he had been
carrying.&nbsp; The barrowman soon returned with another load, and all
continued work for nearly a half-hour, when a coachman came out from
the shadows to the north.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rsquo; he whispered to Vannicock, &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;ve waited so long on Mellstock hill that at last I drove down
to the turnpike; and seeing the light here, I ran on to find out what
had happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Vannicock told him to wait a few minutes, and the last
barrow-load was got through.&nbsp; Mr. Maumbry stretched himself and
breathed heavily, saying, &lsquo;There; we can do no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As if from the relaxation of effort he seemed to be seized with violent
pain.&nbsp; He pressed his hands to his sides and bent forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I think it has got hold of me at last,&rsquo; he
said with difficulty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must try to get home.&nbsp; Let
Mr. Vannicock take you back, Laura.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked a few steps, they helping him, but was obliged to sink
down on the grass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am&mdash;afraid&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to send for a hurdle,
or shutter, or something,&rsquo; he went on feebly, &lsquo;or try to
get me into the barrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Vannicock had called to the driver of the fly, and they waited
until it was brought on from the turnpike hard by.&nbsp; Mr. Maumbry
was placed therein.&nbsp; Laura entered with him, and they drove to
his humble residence near the Cross, where he was got upstairs.</p>
<p>Vannicock stood outside by the empty fly awhile, but Laura did not
reappear.&nbsp; He thereupon entered the fly and told the driver to
take him back to Ivell.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>Mr. Maumbry had over-exerted himself in the relief of the suffering
poor, and fell a victim&mdash;one of the last&mdash;to the pestilence
which had carried off so many.&nbsp; Two days later he lay in his coffin.</p>
<p>Laura was in the room below.&nbsp; A servant brought in some letters,
and she glanced them over.&nbsp; One was the note from herself to Maumbry,
informing him that she was unable to endure life with him any longer
and was about to elope with Vannicock.&nbsp; Having read the letter
she took it upstairs to where the dead man was, and slipped it into
his coffin.&nbsp; The next day she buried him.</p>
<p>She was now free.</p>
<p>She shut up his house at Durnover Cross and returned to her lodgings
at Creston.&nbsp; Soon she had a letter from Vannicock, and six weeks
after her husband&rsquo;s death her lover came to see her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot to give you back this&mdash;that night,&rsquo; he
said presently, handing her the little bag she had taken as her whole
luggage when leaving.</p>
<p>Laura received it and absently shook it out.&nbsp; There fell upon
the carpet her brush, comb, slippers, nightdress, and other simple necessaries
for a journey.&nbsp; They had an intolerably ghastly look now, and she
tried to cover them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;ask you to belong to me
legally&mdash;when a proper interval has gone&mdash;instead of as we
meant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was languor in his utterance, hinting at a possibility that
it was perfunctorily made.&nbsp; Laura picked up her articles, answering
that he certainly could so ask her&mdash;she was free.&nbsp; Yet not
her expression either could be called an ardent response.&nbsp; Then
she blinked more and more quickly and put her handkerchief to her face.&nbsp;
She was weeping violently.</p>
<p>He did not move or try to comfort her in any way.&nbsp; What had
come between them?&nbsp; No living person.&nbsp; They had been lovers.&nbsp;
There was now no material obstacle whatever to their union.&nbsp; But
there was the insistent shadow of that unconscious one; the thin figure
of him, moving to and fro in front of the ghastly furnace in the gloom
of Durnover Moor.</p>
<p>Yet Vannicock called upon Laura when he was in the neighbourhood,
which was not often; but in two years, as if on purpose to further the
marriage which everybody was expecting, the ---st Foot returned to Budmouth
Regis.</p>
<p>Thereupon the two could not help encountering each other at times.&nbsp;
But whether because the obstacle had been the source of the love, or
from a sense of error, and because Mrs. Maumbry bore a less attractive
look as a widow than before, their feelings seemed to decline from their
former incandescence to a mere tepid civility.&nbsp; What domestic issues
supervened in Vannicock&rsquo;s further story the man in the oriel never
knew; but Mrs. Maumbry lived and died a widow.</p>
<p>1900.</p>
<h2>THE WAITING SUPPER</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Whoever had perceived the yeoman standing on Squire Everard&rsquo;s
lawn in the dusk of that October evening fifty years ago, might have
said at first sight that he was loitering there from idle curiosity.&nbsp;
For a large five-light window of the manor-house in front of him was
unshuttered and uncurtained, so that the illuminated room within could
be scanned almost to its four corners.&nbsp; Obviously nobody was ever
expected to be in this part of the grounds after nightfall.</p>
<p>The apartment thus swept by an eye from without was occupied by two
persons; they were sitting over dessert, the tablecloth having been
removed in the old-fashioned way.&nbsp; The fruits were local, consisting
of apples, pears, nuts, and such other products of the summer as might
be presumed to grow on the estate.&nbsp; There was strong ale and rum
on the table, and but little wine.&nbsp; Moreover, the appointments
of the dining-room were simple and homely even for the date, betokening
a countrified household of the smaller gentry, without much wealth or
ambition&mdash;formerly a numerous class, but now in great part ousted
by the territorial landlords.</p>
<p>One of the two sitters was a young lady in white muslin, who listened
somewhat impatiently to the remarks of her companion, an elderly, rubicund
personage, whom the merest stranger could have pronounced to be her
father.&nbsp; The watcher evinced no signs of moving, and it became
evident that affairs were not so simple as they first had seemed.&nbsp;
The tall farmer was in fact no accidental spectator, and he stood by
premeditation close to the trunk of a tree, so that had any traveller
passed along the road without the park gate, or even round the lawn
to the door, that person would scarce have noticed the other, notwithstanding
that the gate was quite near at hand, and the park little larger than
a paddock.&nbsp; There was still light enough in the western heaven
to brighten faintly one side of the man&rsquo;s face, and to show against
the trunk of the tree behind the admirable cut of his profile; also
to reveal that the front of the manor-house, small though it seemed,
was solidly built of stone in that never-to-be-surpassed style for the
English country residence&mdash;the mullioned and transomed Elizabethan.</p>
<p>The lawn, although neglected, was still as level as a bowling-green&mdash;which
indeed it might once have served for; and the blades of grass before
the window were raked by the candle-shine, which stretched over them
so far as to touch the yeoman&rsquo;s face in front.</p>
<p>Within the dining-room there were also, with one of the twain, the
same signs of a hidden purpose that marked the farmer.&nbsp; The young
lady&rsquo;s mind was straying as clearly into the shadows as that of
the loiterer was fixed upon the room&mdash;nay, it could be said that
she was quite conscious of his presence outside.&nbsp; Impatience caused
her foot to beat silently on the carpet, and she more than once rose
to leave the table.&nbsp; This proceeding was checked by her father,
who would put his hand upon her shoulder and unceremoniously press her
down into her chair, till he should have concluded his observations.&nbsp;
Her replies were brief enough, and there was factitiousness in her smiles
of assent to his views.&nbsp; A small iron casement between two of the
mullions was open, and some occasional words of the dialogue were audible
without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for drains&mdash;how can I put in drains?&nbsp; The pipes
don&rsquo;t cost much, that&rsquo;s true; but the labour in sinking
the trenches is ruination.&nbsp; And then the gates&mdash;they should
be hung to stone posts, otherwise there&rsquo;s no keeping them up through
harvest.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Squire&rsquo;s voice was strongly toned with
the local accent, so that he said &lsquo;dra&iuml;ns&rsquo; and &lsquo;ge&auml;ts&rsquo;
like the rustics on his estate.</p>
<p>The landscape without grew darker, and the young man&rsquo;s figure
seemed to be absorbed into the trunk of the tree.&nbsp; The small stars
filled in between the larger, the nebulae between the small stars, the
trees quite lost their voice; and if there was still a sound, it was
from the cascade of a stream which stretched along under the trees that
bounded the lawn on its northern side.</p>
<p>At last the young girl did get to her feet and secure her retreat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have something to do, papa,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall not be in the drawing-room just yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t
hurry.&rsquo;&nbsp; And closing the door behind her, he drew his decanters
together and settled down in his chair.</p>
<p>Three minutes after that a woman&rsquo;s shape emerged from the drawing-room
window, and passing through a wall-door to the entrance front, came
across the grass.&nbsp; She kept well clear of the dining-room window,
but enough of its light fell on her to show, escaping from the dark-hooded
cloak that she wore, stray verges of the same light dress which had
figured but recently at the dinner-table.&nbsp; The hood was contracted
tight about her face with a drawing-string, making her countenance small
and baby-like, and lovelier even than before.</p>
<p>Without hesitation she brushed across the grass to the tree under
which the young man stood concealed.&nbsp; The moment she had reached
him he enclosed her form with his arm.&nbsp; The meeting and embrace,
though by no means formal, were yet not passionate; the whole proceeding
was that of persons who had repeated the act so often as to be unconscious
of its performance.&nbsp; She turned within his arm, and faced in the
same direction with himself, which was towards the window; and thus
they stood without speaking, the back of her head leaning against his
shoulder.&nbsp; For a while each seemed to be thinking his and her diverse
thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have kept me waiting a long time, dear Christine,&rsquo;
he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wanted to speak to you particularly,
or I should not have stayed.&nbsp; How came you to be dining at this
time o&rsquo; night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father has been out all day, and dinner was put back till
six.&nbsp; I know I have kept you; but Nicholas, how can I help it sometimes,
if I am not to run any risk?&nbsp; My poor father insists upon my listening
to all he has to say; since my brother left he has had nobody else to
listen to him; and to-night he was particularly tedious on his usual
topics&mdash;draining, and tenant-farmers, and the village people.&nbsp;
I must take daddy to London; he gets so narrow always staying here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you say to it all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I took the part of the tenant-farmers, of course, as
the beloved of one should in duty do.&rsquo;&nbsp; There followed a
little break or gasp, implying a strangled sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sorry you have encouraged that beloving one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, Nicholas . . . What is it you want to see me for particularly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you are sorry, as time goes on, and everything is at
a dead-lock, with no prospect of change, and your rural swain loses
his freshness!&nbsp; Only think, this secret understanding between us
has lasted near three year, ever since you was a little over sixteen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it has been a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I an untamed, uncultivated man, who has never seen London,
and knows nothing about society at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not uncultivated, dear Nicholas.&nbsp; Untravelled, socially
unpractised, if you will,&rsquo; she said, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
I did sigh; but not because I regret being your promised one.&nbsp;
What I do sometimes regret is that the scheme, which my meetings with
you are but a part of, has not been carried out completely.&nbsp; You
said, Nicholas, that if I consented to swear to keep faith with you,
you would go away and travel, and see nations, and peoples, and cities,
and take a professor with you, and study books and art, simultaneously
with your study of men and manners; and then come back at the end of
two years, when I should find that my father would by no means be indisposed
to accept you as a son-in-law.&nbsp; You said your reason for wishing
to get my promise before starting was that your mind would then be more
at rest when you were far away, and so could give itself more completely
to knowledge than if you went as my unaccepted lover only, fuming with
anxiety as to how I should be when you came back.&nbsp; I saw how reasonable
that was; and solemnly swore myself to you in consequence.&nbsp; But
instead of going to see the world you stay on and on here to see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t want me to see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;it is not that.&nbsp; It is that I have
latterly felt frightened at what I am doing when not in your actual
presence.&nbsp; It seems so wicked not to tell my father that I have
a lover close at hand, within touch and view of both of us; whereas
if you were absent my conduct would not seem quite so treacherous.&nbsp;
The realities would not stare at one so.&nbsp; You would be a pleasant
dream to me, which I should be free to indulge in without reproach of
my conscience; I should live in hopeful expectation of your returning
fully qualified to boldly claim me of my father.&nbsp; There, I have
been terribly frank, I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He in his turn had lapsed into gloomy breathings now.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
did plan it as you state,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did mean
to go away the moment I had your promise.&nbsp; But, dear Christine,
I did not foresee two or three things.&nbsp; I did not know what a lot
of pain it would cost to tear myself from you.&nbsp; And I did not know
that my stingy uncle&mdash;heaven forgive me calling him so!&mdash;would
so flatly refuse to advance me money for my purpose&mdash;the scheme
of travelling with a first-rate tutor costing a formidable sum o&rsquo;
money.&nbsp; You have no idea what it would cost!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have said that I&rsquo;ll find the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, there,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;you have hit a sore
place.&nbsp; To speak truly, dear, I would rather stay unpolished a
hundred years than take your money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why?&nbsp; Men continually use the money of the women
they marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but not till afterwards.&nbsp; No man would like to touch
your money at present, and I should feel very mean if I were to do so
in present circumstances.&nbsp; That brings me to what I was going to
propose.&nbsp; But no&mdash;upon the whole I will not propose it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I would guarantee expenses, and you won&rsquo;t
let me!&nbsp; The money is my personal possession: it comes to me from
my late grandfather, and not from my father at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed forcedly and pressed her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are
more reasons why I cannot tear myself away,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
would become of my uncle&rsquo;s farming?&nbsp; Six hundred acres in
this parish, and five hundred in the next&mdash;a constant traipsing
from one farm to the other; he can&rsquo;t be in two places at once.&nbsp;
Still, that might be got over if it were not for the other matters.&nbsp;
Besides, dear, I still should be a little uneasy, even though I have
your promise, lest somebody should snap you up away from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you should have thought of that before.&nbsp; Otherwise
I have committed myself for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have thought of it,&rsquo; he answered gravely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I did not.&nbsp; There lies my fault, I admit it freely.&nbsp;
Ah, if you would only commit yourself a little more, I might at least
get over that difficulty!&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t ask you.&nbsp; You
have no idea how much you are to me still; you could not argue so coolly
if you had.&nbsp; What property belongs to you I hate the very sound
of; it is you I care for.&nbsp; I wish you hadn&rsquo;t a farthing in
the world but what I could earn for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether wish that,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it, because it would have made what I was going to
propose much easier to do than it is now.&nbsp; Indeed I will not propose
it, although I came on purpose, after what you have said in your frankness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Nic.&nbsp; Come, tell me.&nbsp; How can you be so
touchy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at this then, Christine dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; He drew from
his breast-pocket a sheet of paper and unfolded it, when it was observable
that a seal dangled from the bottom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; She held the paper sideways, so that
what there was of window-light fell on its surface.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can
only read the Old English letters&mdash;why&mdash;our names!&nbsp; Surely
it is not a marriage-licence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She trembled.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Nic! how could you do this&mdash;and
without telling me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I have thought I must tell you?&nbsp; You had not
spoken &ldquo;frankly&rdquo; then as you have now.&nbsp; We have been
all to each other more than these two years, and I thought I would propose
that we marry privately, and that I then leave you on the instant.&nbsp;
I would have taken my travelling-bag to church, and you would have gone
home alone.&nbsp; I should not have started on my adventures in the
brilliant manner of our original plan, but should have roughed it a
little at first; my great gain would have been that the absolute possession
of you would have enabled me to work with spirit and purpose, such as
nothing else could do.&nbsp; But I dare not ask you now&mdash;so frank
as you have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer.&nbsp; The document he had produced gave such
unexpected substantiality to the venture with which she had so long
toyed as a vague dream merely, that she was, in truth, frightened a
little.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know about it!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; Ah, my little lady, you are wearying of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Nic,&rsquo; responded she, creeping closer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am not.&nbsp; Upon my word, and truth, and honour, I am not, Nic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mere tiller of the soil, as I should be called,&rsquo; he
continued, without heeding her.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you&mdash;well, a daughter
of one of the&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say oldest families, because that&rsquo;s
absurd, all families are the same age&mdash;one of the longest chronicled
families about here, whose name is actually the name of the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not much, I am sorry to say!&nbsp; My poor brother&mdash;but
I won&rsquo;t speak of that . . . Well,&rsquo; she murmured mischievously,
after a pause, &lsquo;you certainly would not need to be uneasy if I
were to do this that you want me to do.&nbsp; You would have me safe
enough in your trap then; I couldn&rsquo;t get away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rsquo; he said vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
<i>is</i> a trap&mdash;you feel it so, and that though you wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to get away from me you might particularly wish to!&nbsp; Ah,
if I had asked you two years ago you would have agreed instantly.&nbsp;
But I thought I was bound to wait for the proposal to come from you
as the superior!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you are angry, and take seriously what I meant purely
in fun.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know me even yet!&nbsp; To show you that
you have not been mistaken in me, I do propose to carry out this licence.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll marry you, dear Nicholas, to-morrow morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Christine!&nbsp; I am afraid I have stung you on to this,
so that I cannot&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; she hastily rejoined; and there was something
in her tone which suggested that she had been put upon her mettle and
would not flinch.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take me whilst I am in the humour.&nbsp;
What church is the licence for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I&rsquo;ve not looked to see&mdash;why our parish church
here, of course.&nbsp; Ah, then we cannot use it!&nbsp; We dare not
be married here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We do dare,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;And we will too,
if you&rsquo;ll be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;If</i> I&rsquo;ll be there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They speedily came to an agreement that he should be in the church-porch
at ten minutes to eight on the following morning, awaiting her; and
that, immediately after the conclusion of the service which would make
them one, Nicholas should set out on his long-deferred educational tour,
towards the cost of which she was resolving to bring a substantial subscription
with her to church.&nbsp; Then, slipping from him, she went indoors
by the way she had come, and Nicholas bent his steps homewards.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Instead of leaving the spot by the gate, he flung himself over the
fence, and pursued a direction towards the river under the trees.&nbsp;
And it was now, in his lonely progress, that he showed for the first
time outwardly that he was not altogether unworthy of her.&nbsp; He
wore long water-boots reaching above his knees, and, instead of making
a circuit to find a bridge by which he might cross the Froom&mdash;the
river aforesaid&mdash;he made straight for the point whence proceeded
the low roar that was at this hour the only evidence of the stream&rsquo;s
existence.&nbsp; He speedily stood on the verge of the waterfall which
caused the noise, and stepping into the water at the top of the fall,
waded through with the sure tread of one who knew every inch of his
footing, even though the canopy of trees rendered the darkness almost
absolute, and a false step would have precipitated him into the pool
beneath.&nbsp; Soon reaching the boundary of the grounds, he continued
in the same direct line to traverse the alluvial valley, full of brooks
and tributaries to the main stream&mdash;in former times quite impassable,
and impassable in winter now.&nbsp; Sometimes he would cross a deep
gully on a plank not wider than the hand; at another time he ploughed
his way through beds of spear-grass, where at a few feet to the right
or left he might have been sucked down into a morass.&nbsp; At last
he reached firm land on the other side of this watery tract, and came
to his house on the rise behind&mdash;Elsenford&mdash;an ordinary farmstead,
from the back of which rose indistinct breathings, belchings, and snortings,
the rattle of halters, and other familiar features of an agriculturist&rsquo;s
home.</p>
<p>While Nicholas Long was packing his bag in an upper room of this
dwelling, Miss Christine Everard sat at a desk in her own chamber at
Froom-Everard manor-house, looking with pale fixed countenance at the
candles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought&mdash;I must now!&rsquo; she whispered to herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should not have begun it if I had not meant to carry it through!&nbsp;
It runs in the blood of us, I suppose.&rsquo;&nbsp; She alluded to a
fact unknown to her lover, the clandestine marriage of an aunt under
circumstances somewhat similar to the present.&nbsp; In a few minutes
she had penned the following note:-</p>
<blockquote><p>October 13, 183-.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. BEALAND&mdash;Can you make it convenient to yourself to
meet me at the Church to-morrow morning at eight?&nbsp; I name the early
hour because it would suit me better than later on in the day.&nbsp;
You will find me in the chancel, if you can come.&nbsp; An answer yes
or no by the bearer of this will be sufficient.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE EVERARD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sent the note to the rector immediately, waiting at a small side-door
of the house till she heard the servant&rsquo;s footsteps returning
along the lane, when she went round and met him in the passage.&nbsp;
The rector had taken the trouble to write a line, and answered that
he would meet her with pleasure.</p>
<p>A dripping fog which ushered in the next morning was highly favourable
to the scheme of the pair.&nbsp; At that time of the century Froom-Everard
House had not been altered and enlarged; the public lane passed close
under its walls; and there was a door opening directly from one of the
old parlours&mdash;the south parlour, as it was called&mdash;into the
lane which led to the village.&nbsp; Christine came out this way, and
after following the lane for a short distance entered upon a path within
a belt of plantation, by which the church could be reached privately.&nbsp;
She even avoided the churchyard gate, walking along to a place where
the turf without the low wall rose into a mound, enabling her to mount
upon the coping and spring down inside.&nbsp; She crossed the wet graves,
and so glided round to the door.&nbsp; He was there, with his bag in
his hand.&nbsp; He kissed her with a sort of surprise, as if he had
expected that at the last moment her heart would fail her.</p>
<p>Though it had not failed her, there was, nevertheless, no great ardour
in Christine&rsquo;s bearing&mdash;merely the momentum of an antecedent
impulse.&nbsp; They went up the aisle together, the bottle-green glass
of the old lead quarries admitting but little light at that hour, and
under such an atmosphere.&nbsp; They stood by the altar-rail in silence,
Christine&rsquo;s skirt visibly quivering at each beat of her heart.</p>
<p>Presently a quick step ground upon the gravel, and Mr. Bealand came
round by the front.&nbsp; He was a quiet bachelor, courteous towards
Christine, and not at first recognizing in Nicholas a neighbouring yeoman
(for he lived aloofly in the next parish), advanced to her without revealing
any surprise at her unusual request.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in truth he was
surprised, the keen interest taken by many country young women at the
present day in church decoration and festivals being then unknown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; he said; and repeated the same words
to Nicholas more mechanically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; she replied gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Bealand, I have a serious reason for asking you to meet me&mdash;us,
I may say.&nbsp; We wish you to marry us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rector&rsquo;s gaze hardened to fixity, rather between than upon
either of them, and he neither moved nor replied for some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we are quite ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no idea&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been kept rather private,&rsquo; she said calmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are your witnesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are outside in the meadow, sir.&nbsp; I can call them
in a moment,&rsquo; said Nicholas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;I see it is&mdash;Mr. Nicholas Long,&rsquo; said
Mr. Bealand, and turning again to Christine, &lsquo;Does your father
know of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it necessary that I should answer that question, Mr. Bealand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid it is&mdash;highly necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christine began to look concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the licence?&rsquo; the rector asked; &lsquo;since
there have been no banns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas produced it, Mr. Bealand read it, an operation which occupied
him several minutes&mdash;or at least he made it appear so; till Christine
said impatiently, &lsquo;We are quite ready, Mr. Bealand.&nbsp; Will
you proceed?&nbsp; Mr. Long has to take a journey of a great many miles
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I remain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bealand assumed firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is something wrong
in this,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot marry you without your
father&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But have you a right to refuse us?&rsquo; interposed Nicholas.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I believe we are in a position to demand your fulfilment of our
request.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you are not!&nbsp; Is Miss Everard of age?&nbsp; I think
not.&nbsp; I think she is months from being so.&nbsp; Eh, Miss Everard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I bound to tell that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; At any rate you are bound to write it.&nbsp;
Meanwhile I refuse to solemnize the service.&nbsp; And let me entreat
you two young people to do nothing so rash as this, even if by going
to some strange church, you may do so without discovery.&nbsp; The tragedy
of marriage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tragedy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; It is full of crises and catastrophes, and
ends with the death of one of the actors.&nbsp; The tragedy of marriage,
as I was saying, is one I shall not be a party to your beginning with
such light hearts, and I shall feel bound to put your father on his
guard, Miss Everard.&nbsp; Think better of it, I entreat you!&nbsp;
Remember the proverb, &ldquo;Marry in haste and repent at leisure.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christine, spurred by opposition, almost stormed at him.&nbsp; Nicholas
implored; but nothing would turn that obstinate rector.&nbsp; She sat
down and reflected.&nbsp; By-and-by she confronted Mr. Bealand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our marriage is not to be this morning, I see,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now grant me one favour, and in return I&rsquo;ll
promise you to do nothing rashly.&nbsp; Do not tell my father a word
of what has happened here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agree&mdash;if you undertake not to elope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Nicholas, and he looked at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
wish me to elope, Nic?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>So the compact was made, and they left the church singly, Nicholas
remaining till the last, and closing the door.&nbsp; On his way home,
carrying the well-packed bag which was just now to go no further, the
two men who were mending water-carriers in the meadows approached the
hedge, as if they had been on the alert all the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said you mid want us for zummat, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right&mdash;never mind,&rsquo; he answered through the
hedge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not require you after all.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>At a manor not far away there lived a queer and primitive couple
who had lately been blessed with a son and heir.&nbsp; The christening
took place during the week under notice, and this had been followed
by a feast to the parishioners.&nbsp; Christine&rsquo;s father, one
of the same generation and kind, had been asked to drive over and assist
in the entertainment, and Christine, as a matter of course, accompanied
him.</p>
<p>When they reached Athelhall, as the house was called, they found
the usually quiet nook a lively spectacle.&nbsp; Tables had been spread
in the apartment which lent its name to the whole building&mdash;the
hall proper&mdash;covered with a fine open-timbered roof, whose braces,
purlins, and rafters made a brown thicket of oak overhead.&nbsp; Here
tenantry of all ages sat with their wives and families, and the servants
were assisted in their ministrations by the sons and daughters of the
owner&rsquo;s friends and neighbours.&nbsp; Christine lent a hand among
the rest.</p>
<p>She was holding a plate in each hand towards a huge brown platter
of baked rice-pudding, from which a footman was scooping a large spoonful,
when a voice reached her ear over her shoulder: &lsquo;Allow me to hold
them for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christine turned, and recognized in the speaker the nephew of the
entertainer, a young man from London, whom she had already met on two
or three occasions.</p>
<p>She accepted the proffered help, and from that moment, whenever he
passed her in their marchings to and fro during the remainder of the
serving, he smiled acquaintance.&nbsp; When their work was done, he
improved the few words into a conversation.&nbsp; He plainly had been
attracted by her fairness.</p>
<p>Bellston was a self-assured young man, not particularly good-looking,
with more colour in his skin than even Nicholas had.&nbsp; He had flushed
a little in attracting her notice, though the flush had nothing of nervousness
in it&mdash;the air with which it was accompanied making it curiously
suggestive of a flush of anger; and even when he laughed it was difficult
to banish that fancy.</p>
<p>The late autumn sunlight streamed in through the window panes upon
the heads and shoulders of the venerable patriarchs of the hamlet, and
upon the middle-aged, and upon the young; upon men and women who had
played out, or were to play, tragedies or tragi-comedies in that nook
of civilization not less great, essentially, than those which, enacted
on more central arenas, fix the attention of the world.&nbsp; One of
the party was a cousin of Nicholas Long&rsquo;s, who sat with her husband
and children.</p>
<p>To make himself as locally harmonious as possible, Mr. Bellston remarked
to his companion on the scene&mdash;&lsquo;It does one&rsquo;s heart
good,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to see these simple peasants enjoying themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Mr. Bellston!&rsquo; exclaimed Christine; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
be too sure about that word &ldquo;simple&rdquo;!&nbsp; You little think
what they see and meditate!&nbsp; Their reasonings and emotions are
as complicated as ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with a vehemence which would have been hardly present in
her words but for her own relation to Nicholas.&nbsp; The sense of that
produced in her a nameless depression thenceforward.&nbsp; The young
man, however, still followed her up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear you say it,&rsquo; he returned warmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was merely attuning myself to your mood, as I thought.&nbsp;
The real truth is that I know more of the Parthians, and Medes, and
dwellers in Mesopotamia&mdash;almost of any people, indeed&mdash;than
of the English rustics.&nbsp; Travel and exploration are my profession,
not the study of the British peasantry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Travel.&nbsp; There was sufficient coincidence between his declaration
and the course she had urged upon her lover, to lend Bellston&rsquo;s
account of himself a certain interest in Christine&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp;
He might perhaps be able to tell her something that would be useful
to Nicholas, if their dream were carried out.&nbsp; A door opened from
the hall into the garden, and she somehow found herself outside, chatting
with Mr. Bellston on this topic, till she thought that upon the whole
she liked the young man.&nbsp; The garden being his uncle&rsquo;s, he
took her round it with an air of proprietorship; and they went on amongst
the Michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums, and through a door to the
fruit-garden.&nbsp; A green-house was open, and he went in and cut her
a bunch of grapes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How daring of you!&nbsp; They are your uncle&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;I do anything here.&nbsp; A rough
old buffer, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of her Nic, and felt that, by comparison with her
present acquaintance, the farmer more than held his own as a fine and
intelligent fellow; but the harmony with her own existence in little
things, which she found here, imparted an alien tinge to Nicholas just
now.&nbsp; The latter, idealized by moonlight, or a thousand miles of
distance, was altogether a more romantic object for a woman&rsquo;s
dream than this smart new-lacquered man; but in the sun of afternoon,
and amid a surrounding company, Mr. Bellston was a very tolerable companion.</p>
<p>When they re-entered the hall, Bellston entreated her to come with
him up a spiral stair in the thickness of the wall, leading to a passage
and gallery whence they could look down upon the scene below.&nbsp;
The people had finished their feast, the newly-christened baby had been
exhibited, and a few words having been spoken to them they began, amid
a racketing of forms, to make for the greensward without, Nicholas&rsquo;s
cousin and cousin&rsquo;s wife and cousin&rsquo;s children among the
rest.&nbsp; While they were filing out, a voice was heard calling&mdash;&lsquo;Hullo!&mdash;here,
Jim; where are you?&rsquo; said Bellston&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp; The young
man descended, Christine following at leisure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now will ye be a good fellow,&rsquo; the Squire continued,
&lsquo;and set them going outside in some dance or other that they know?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m dog-tired, and I want to have a yew words with Mr. Everard
before we join &rsquo;em&mdash;hey, Everard?&nbsp; They are shy till
somebody starts &rsquo;em; afterwards they&rsquo;ll keep gwine brisk
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, that they wool,&rsquo; said Squire Everard.</p>
<p>They followed to the lawn; and here it proved that James Bellston
was as shy, or rather as averse, as any of the tenantry themselves,
to acting the part of fugleman.&nbsp; Only the parish people had been
at the feast, but outlying neighbours had now strolled in for a dance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They want &ldquo;Speed the Plough,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Bellston,
coming up breathless.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be a country dance, I suppose?&nbsp;
Now, Miss Everard, do have pity upon me.&nbsp; I am supposed to lead
off; but really I know no more about speeding the plough than a child
just born!&nbsp; Would you take one of the villagers?&mdash;just to
start them, my uncle says.&nbsp; Suppose you take that handsome young
farmer over there&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know his name, but I dare say
you do&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll come on with one of the dairyman&rsquo;s
daughters as a second couple.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christine turned in the direction signified, and changed colour&mdash;though
in the shade nobody noticed it, &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I know him,&rsquo;
she said coolly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is from near our own place&mdash;Mr.
Nicholas Long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s capital&mdash;then you can easily make him stand
as first couple with you.&nbsp; Now I must pick up mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll dance with you, Mr. Bellston,&rsquo;
she said with some trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because, you see,&rsquo;
she explained eagerly, &lsquo;I know the figure and you don&rsquo;t&mdash;so
that I can help you; while Nicholas Long, I know, is familiar with the
figure, and that will make two couples who know it&mdash;which is necessary,
at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bellston showed his gratification by one of his angry-pleasant flushes&mdash;he
had hardly dared to ask for what she proffered freely; and having requested
Nicholas to take the dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, led Christine to her
place, Long promptly stepping up second with his charge.&nbsp; There
were grim silent depths in Nic&rsquo;s character; a small deedy spark
in his eye, as it caught Christine&rsquo;s, was all that showed his
consciousness of her.&nbsp; Then the fiddlers began&mdash;the celebrated
Mellstock fiddlers who, given free stripping, could play from sunset
to dawn without turning a hair.&nbsp; The couples wheeled and swung,
Nicholas taking Christine&rsquo;s hand in the course of business with
the figure, when she waited for him to give it a little squeeze; but
he did not.</p>
<p>Christine had the greatest difficulty in steering her partner through
the maze, on account of his self-will, and when at last they reached
the bottom of the long line, she was breathless with her hard labour..&nbsp;
Resting here, she watched Nic and his lady; and, though she had decidedly
cooled off in these later months, began to admire him anew.&nbsp; Nobody
knew these dances like him, after all, or could do anything of this
sort so well.&nbsp; His performance with the dairyman&rsquo;s daughter
so won upon her, that when &lsquo;Speed the Plough&rsquo; was over she
contrived to speak to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nic, you are to dance with me next time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said he would, and presently asked her in a formal public manner,
lifting his hat gallantly.&nbsp; She showed a little backwardness, which
he quite understood, and allowed him to lead her to the top, a row of
enormous length appearing below them as if by magic as soon as they
had taken their places.&nbsp; Truly the Squire was right when he said
that they only wanted starting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it to be?&rsquo; whispered Nicholas.</p>
<p>She turned to the band.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Honeymoon,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>And then they trod the delightful last-century measure of that name,
which if it had been ever danced better, was never danced with more
zest.&nbsp; The perfect responsiveness which their tender acquaintance
threw into the motions of Nicholas and his partner lent to their gyrations
the fine adjustment of two interacting parts of a single machine.&nbsp;
The excitement of the movement carried Christine back to the time&mdash;the
unreflecting passionate time, about two years before&mdash;when she
and Nic had been incipient lovers only; and it made her forget the carking
anxieties, the vision of social breakers ahead, that had begun to take
the gilding off her position now.&nbsp; Nicholas, on his part, had never
ceased to be a lover; no personal worries had as yet made him conscious
of any staleness, flatness, or unprofitableness in his admiration of
Christine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite so wildly, Nic,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t object personally; but they&rsquo;ll notice us.&nbsp; How
came you here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard that you had driven over; and I set out&mdash;on purpose
for this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;you have walked?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; If I had waited for one of uncle&rsquo;s horses
I should have been too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five miles here and five back&mdash;ten miles on foot&mdash;merely
to dance!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With you.&nbsp; What made you think of this old &ldquo;Honeymoon&rdquo;
thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! it came into my head when I saw you, as what would have
been a reality with us if you had not been stupid about that licence,
and had got it for a distant church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we try again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll think it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The villagers admired their grace and skill, as the dancers themselves
perceived; but they did not know what accompanied that admiration in
one spot, at least.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People who wonder they can foot it so featly together should
know what some others think,&rsquo; a waterman was saying to his neighbour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then their wonder would be less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His comrade asked for information.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;really I hardly believe it&mdash;but &rsquo;tis
said they be man and wife.&nbsp; Yes, sure&mdash;went to church and
did the job a&rsquo;most afore &rsquo;twas light one morning.&nbsp;
But mind, not a word of this; for &rsquo;twould be the loss of a winter&rsquo;s
work to me if I had spread such a report and it were not true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the dance had ended she rejoined her own section of the company.&nbsp;
Her father and Mr. Bellston the elder had now come out from the house,
and were smoking in the background.&nbsp; Presently she found that her
father was at her elbow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christine, don&rsquo;t dance too often with young Long&mdash;as
a mere matter of prudence, I mean, as volk might think it odd, he being
one of our own neighbouring farmers.&nbsp; I should not mention this
to &rsquo;ee if he were an ordinary young fellow; but being superior
to the rest it behoves you to be careful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly, papa,&rsquo; said Christine.</p>
<p>But the revived sense that she was deceiving him threw a damp over
her spirits.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, after all,&rsquo; she said to herself,
&lsquo;he is a young man of Elsenford, handsome, able, and the soul
of honour; and I am a young woman of the adjoining parish, who have
been constantly thrown into communication with him.&nbsp; Is it not,
by nature&rsquo;s rule, the most proper thing in the world that I should
marry him, and is it not an absurd conventional regulation which says
that such a union would be wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be concluded that the strength of Christine&rsquo;s large-minded
argument was rather an evidence of weakness than of strength in the
passion it concerned, which had required neither argument nor reasoning
of any kind for its maintenance when full and flush in its early days.</p>
<p>When driving home in the dark with her father she sank into pensive
silence.&nbsp; She was thinking of Nicholas having to trudge on foot
all those miles back after his exertions on the sward.&nbsp; Mr. Everard,
arousing himself from a nap, said suddenly, &lsquo;I have something
to mention to &rsquo;ee, by George&mdash;so I have, Chris!&nbsp; You
probably know what it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She expressed ignorance, wondering if her father had discovered anything
of her secret.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, according to <i>him</i> you know it.&nbsp; But I will
tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Perhaps you noticed young Jim Bellston walking
me off down the lawn with him?&mdash;whether or no, we walked together
a good while; and he informed me that he wanted to pay his addresses
to &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; I naturally said that it depended upon yourself;
and he replied that you were willing enough; you had given him particular
encouragement&mdash;showing your preference for him by specially choosing
him for your partner&mdash;hey?&nbsp; &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;go on and conquer&mdash;settle it with her&mdash;I have no
objection.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor fellow was very grateful, and in short,
there we left the matter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll propose to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw now to her dismay what James Bellston had read as encouragement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He has mistaken me altogether,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
had no idea of such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, you won&rsquo;t have him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I cannot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chrissy,&rsquo; said Mr. Everard with emphasis, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
<i>noo</i>body whom I should so like you to marry as that young man.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a thoroughly clever fellow, and fairly well provided for.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s travelled all over the temperate zone; but he says that directly
he marries he&rsquo;s going to give up all that, and be a regular stay-at-home.&nbsp;
You would be nowhere safer than in his hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;He <i>is</i>
a highly desirable match, and I <i>should</i> be well provided for,
and probably very safe in his hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t be skittish, and stand-to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had spoken from her conscience and understanding, and not to
please her father.&nbsp; As a reflecting woman she believed that such
a marriage would be a wise one.&nbsp; In great things Nicholas was closest
to her nature; in little things Bellston seemed immeasurably nearer
than Nic; and life was made up of little things.</p>
<p>Altogether the firmament looked black for Nicholas Long, notwithstanding
her half-hour&rsquo;s ardour for him when she saw him dancing with the
dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Most great passions, movements, and
beliefs&mdash;individual and national&mdash;burst during their decline
into a temporary irradiation, which rivals their original splendour;
and then they speedily become extinct.&nbsp; Perhaps the dance had given
the last flare-up to Christine&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; It seemed to have
improvidently consumed for its immediate purpose all her ardour forwards,
so that for the future there was nothing left but frigidity.</p>
<p>Nicholas had certainly been very foolish about that licence!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>This laxity of emotional tone was further increased by an incident,
when, two days later, she kept an appointment with Nicholas in the Sallows.&nbsp;
The Sallows was an extension of shrubberies and plantations along the
banks of the Froom, accessible from the lawn of Froom-Everard House
only, except by wading through the river at the waterfall or elsewhere.&nbsp;
Near the brink was a thicket of box in which a trunk lay prostrate;
this had been once or twice their trysting-place, though it was by no
means a safe one; and it was here she sat awaiting him now.</p>
<p>The noise of the stream muffled any sound of footsteps, and it was
before she was aware of his approach that she looked up and saw him
wading across at the top of the waterfall.</p>
<p>Noontide lights and dwarfed shadows always banished the romantic
aspect of her love for Nicholas.&nbsp; Moreover, something new had occurred
to disturb her; and if ever she had regretted giving way to a tenderness
for him&mdash;which perhaps she had not done with any distinctness&mdash;she
regretted it now.&nbsp; Yet in the bottom of their hearts those two
were excellently paired, the very twin halves of a perfect whole; and
their love was pure.&nbsp; But at this hour surfaces showed garishly,
and obscured the depths.&nbsp; Probably her regret appeared in her face.</p>
<p>He walked up to her without speaking, the water running from his
boots; and, taking one of her hands in each of his own, looked narrowly
into her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you thought it over?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>What</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether we shall try again; you remember saying you would
at the dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I had forgotten that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sorry we tried at all!&rsquo; he said accusingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not so sorry for the fact as for the rumours,&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! rumours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They say we are already married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell exactly.&nbsp; I heard some whispering to that
effect.&nbsp; Somebody in the village told one of the servants, I believe.&nbsp;
This man said that he was crossing the churchyard early on that unfortunate
foggy morning, and heard voices in the chancel, and peeped through the
window as well as the dim panes would let him; and there he saw you
and me and Mr. Bealand, and so on; but thinking his surmises would be
dangerous knowledge, he hastened on.&nbsp; And so the story got afloat.&nbsp;
Then your aunt, too&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Lord!&mdash;what has she done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story was, told her, and she said proudly, &ldquo;O yes, it is
true enough.&nbsp; I have seen the licence.&nbsp; But it is not to be
known yet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seen the licence?&nbsp; How the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accidentally, I believe, when your coat was hanging somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The information, coupled with the infelicitous word &lsquo;proudly,&rsquo;
caused Nicholas to flush with mortification.&nbsp; He knew that it was
in his aunt&rsquo;s nature to make a brag of that sort; but worse than
the brag was the fact that this was the first occasion on which Christine
had deigned to show her consciousness that such a marriage would be
a source of pride to his relatives&mdash;the only two he had in the
world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sorry, then, even to be thought my wife, much less
to be it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He dropped her hand, which fell lifelessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not sorry exactly, dear Nic.&nbsp; But I feel uncomfortable
and vexed, that after screwing up my courage, my fidelity, to the point
of going to church, you should have so muddled&mdash;managed the matter
that it has ended in neither one thing nor the other.&nbsp; How can
I meet acquaintances, when I don&rsquo;t know what they are thinking
of me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, dear Christine, let us mend the muddle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go away for a few days and get another licence, and you can come to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shrank from this perceptibly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot screw myself
up to it a second time,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure I cannot!&nbsp;
Besides, I promised Mr. Bealand.&nbsp; And yet how can I continue to
see you after such a rumour?&nbsp; We shall be watched now, for certain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear I must not for the present.&nbsp; Altogether&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very depressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These views were not very inspiriting to Nicholas, as he construed
them.&nbsp; It may indeed have been possible that he construed them
wrongly, and should have insisted upon her making the rumour true.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, too, he had come to her in a hurry through brambles and
briars, water and weed, and the shaggy wildness which hung about his
appearance at this fine and correct time of day lent an impracticability
to the look of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You blame me&mdash;you repent your courses&mdash;you repent
that you ever, ever owned anything to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Nicholas, I do not repent that,&rsquo; she returned gently,
though with firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I think that you ought not to
have got that licence without asking me first; and I also think that
you ought to have known how it would be if you lived on here in your
present position, and made no effort to better it.&nbsp; I can bear
whatever comes, for social ruin is not personal ruin or even personal
disgrace.&nbsp; But as a sensible, new-risen poet says, whom I have
been reading this morning:-</p>
<blockquote><p>The world and its ways have a certain worth:<br />
And to press a point while these oppose<br />
Were simple policy.&nbsp; Better wait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as you had got my promise, Nic, you should have gone away&mdash;yes&mdash;and
made a name, and come back to claim me.&nbsp; That was my silly girlish
dream about my hero.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I can do as much yet!&nbsp; And would you have indeed
liked better to live away from me for family reasons, than to run a
risk in seeing me for affection&rsquo;s sake?&nbsp; O what a cold heart
it has grown!&nbsp; If I had been a prince, and you a dairymaid, I&rsquo;d
have stood by you in the face of the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what
society is&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; Who was that strange gentleman of about
seven-and-twenty I saw at Mr. Bellston&rsquo;s christening feast?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;that was his nephew James.&nbsp; Now he is a man
who has seen an unusual extent of the world for his age.&nbsp; He is
a great traveller, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact an explorer.&nbsp; He is very entertaining.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas received no shock of jealousy from her announcement.&nbsp;
He knew her so well that he could see she was not in the least in love
with Bellston.&nbsp; But he asked if Bellston were going to continue
his explorations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not if he settles in life.&nbsp; Otherwise he will, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I could be a great explorer, too, if I tried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could, I am sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They sat apart, and not together; each looking afar off at vague
objects, and not in each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Thus the sad autumn
afternoon waned, while the waterfall hissed sarcastically of the inevitableness
of the unpleasant.&nbsp; Very different this from the time when they
had first met there.</p>
<p>The nook was most picturesque; but it looked horridly common and
stupid now.&nbsp; Their sentiment had set a colour hardly less visible
than a material one on surrounding objects, as sentiment must where
life is but thought.&nbsp; Nicholas was as devoted as ever to the fair
Christine; but unhappily he too had moods and humours, and the division
between them was not closed.</p>
<p>She had no sooner got indoors and sat down to her work-table than
her father entered the drawing-room.</p>
<p>She handed him his newspaper; he took it without a word, went and
stood on the hearthrug, and flung the paper on the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christine, what&rsquo;s the meaning of this terrible story?&nbsp;
I was just on my way to look at the register.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him without speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have married&mdash;Nicholas Long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No?&nbsp; Can you say no in the face of such facts as I have
been put in possession of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;the note you wrote to the rector&mdash;and the going
to church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She briefly explained that their attempt had failed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then this is what that dancing meant, was it?&nbsp;
By ---, it makes me&nbsp; ---.&nbsp; How long has this been going on,
may I ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, indeed!&nbsp; Why, making him your beau.&nbsp; Now listen
to me.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s well that ends well; from this day, madam,
this moment, he is to be nothing more to you.&nbsp; You are not to see
him.&nbsp; Cut him adrift instantly!&nbsp; I only wish his volk were
on my farm&mdash;out they should go, or I would know the reason why.&nbsp;
However, you are to write him a letter to this effect at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I cut him adrift?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&nbsp; You must, my good maid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, though I have not actually married him, I have solemnly
sworn to be his wife when he comes home from abroad to claim me.&nbsp;
It would be gross perjury not to fulfil my promise.&nbsp; Besides, no
woman can go to church with a man to deliberately solemnize matrimony,
and refuse him afterwards, if he does nothing wrong meanwhile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The uttered sound of her strong conviction seemed to kindle in Christine
a livelier perception of all its bearings than she had known while it
had lain unformulated in her mind.&nbsp; For when she had done speaking
she fell down on her knees before her father, covered her face, and
said, &lsquo;Please, please forgive me, papa!&nbsp; How could I do it
without letting you know!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she looked up she found that, in the turmoil of his mind, her
father was moving about the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are within an ace
of ruining yourself, ruining me, ruining us all!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are nearly as bad as your brother, begad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I am&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps I am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I should father such a harum-scarum brood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very bad; but Nicholas&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a scoundrel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is <i>not</i> a scoundrel!&rsquo; cried she, turning quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s as good and worthy as you or I, or anybody bearing
our name, or any nobleman in the kingdom, if you come to that!&nbsp;
Only&mdash;only&rsquo;&mdash;she could not continue the argument on
those lines.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, father, listen!&rsquo; she sobbed; &lsquo;if
you taunt me I&rsquo;ll go off and join him at his farm this very day,
and marry him to-morrow, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t taant ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to avoid unseemliness as much as you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went away.&nbsp; When she came back a quarter of an hour later,
thinking to find the room empty, he was standing there as before, never
having apparently moved.&nbsp; His manner had quite changed.&nbsp; He
seemed to take a resigned and entirely different view of circumstances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christine, here&rsquo;s a paragraph in the paper hinting at
a secret wedding, and I&rsquo;m blazed if it don&rsquo;t point to you.&nbsp;
Well, since this was to happen, I&rsquo;ll bear it, and not complain.&nbsp;
All volk have crosses, and this is one of mine.&nbsp; Now, this is what
I&rsquo;ve got to say&mdash;I feel that you must carry out this attempt
at marrying Nicholas Long.&nbsp; Faith, you must!&nbsp; The rumour will
become a scandal if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s my view.&nbsp;
I have tried to look at the brightest side of the case.&nbsp; Nicholas
Long is a young man superior to most of his class, and fairly presentable.&nbsp;
And he&rsquo;s not poor&mdash;at least his uncle is not.&nbsp; I believe
the old muddler could buy me up any day.&nbsp; However, a farmer&rsquo;s
wife you must be, as far as I can see.&nbsp; As you&rsquo;ve made your
bed, so ye must lie.&nbsp; Parents propose, and ungrateful children
dispose.&nbsp; You shall marry him, and immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christine hardly knew what to make of this.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is quite
willing to wait, and so am I.&nbsp; We can wait for two or three years,
and then he will be as worthy as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must marry him.&nbsp; And the sooner the better, if &rsquo;tis
to be done at all . . . And yet I did wish you could have been Jim Bellston&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; I did wish it!&nbsp; But no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, too, wished it and do still, in one sense,&rsquo; she returned
gently.&nbsp; His moderation had won her out of her defiant mood, and
she was willing to reason with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do?&rsquo; he said surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see that in a worldly sense my conduct with Mr. Long may
be considered a mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;I am glad to hear that&mdash;after my death
you may see it more clearly still; and you won&rsquo;t have long to
wait, to my reckoning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She fell into bitter repentance, and kissed him in her anguish.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me
what to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll leave me for an hour or two I&rsquo;ll think.&nbsp;
Drive to the market and back&mdash;the carriage is at the door&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll try to collect my senses.&nbsp; Dinner can be put back till
you return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was dressed, and the carriage bore her up the
hill which divided the village and manor from the market-town.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>A quarter of an hour brought her into the High Street, and for want
of a more important errand she called at the harness-maker&rsquo;s for
a dog-collar that she required.</p>
<p>It happened to be market-day, and Nicholas, having postponed the
engagements which called him thither to keep the appointment with her
in the Sallows, rushed off at the end of the afternoon to attend to
them as well as he could.&nbsp; Arriving thus in a great hurry on account
of the lateness of the hour, he still retained the wild, amphibious
appearance which had marked him when he came up from the meadows to
her side&mdash;an exceptional condition of things which had scarcely
ever before occurred.&nbsp; When she crossed the pavement from the shop
door, the shopman bowing and escorting her to the carriage, Nicholas
chanced to be standing at the road-waggon office, talking to the master
of the waggons.&nbsp; There were a good many people about, and those
near paused and looked at her transit, in the full stroke of the level
October sun, which went under the brims of their hats, and pierced through
their button-holes.&nbsp; From the group she heard murmured the words:
&lsquo;Mrs. Nicholas Long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unexpected remark, not without distinct satire in its tone, took
her so greatly by surprise that she was confounded.&nbsp; Nicholas was
by this time nearer, though coming against the sun he had not yet perceived
her.&nbsp; Influenced by her father&rsquo;s lecture, she felt angry
with him for being there and causing this awkwardness.&nbsp; Her notice
of him was therefore slight, supercilious perhaps, slurred over; and
her vexation at his presence showed distinctly in her face as she sat
down in her seat.&nbsp; Instead of catching his waiting eye, she positively
turned her head away.</p>
<p>A moment after she was sorry she had treated him so; but he was gone.</p>
<p>Reaching home she found on her dressing-table a note from her father.&nbsp;
The statement was brief:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have considered and am of the same opinion.&nbsp; You
must marry him.&nbsp; He can leave home at once and travel as proposed.&nbsp;
I have written to him to this effect.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want any victuals,
so don&rsquo;t wait dinner for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nicholas was the wrong kind of man to be blind to his Christine&rsquo;s
mortification, though he did not know its entire cause.&nbsp; He had
lately foreseen something of this sort as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It serves me right,&rsquo; he thought, as he trotted homeward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was absurd&mdash;wicked of me to lead her on so.&nbsp; The
sacrifice would have been too great&mdash;too cruel!&rsquo;&nbsp; And
yet, though he thus took her part, he flushed with indignation every
time he said to himself, &lsquo;She is ashamed of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the ridge which overlooked Froom-Everard he met a neighbour of
his&mdash;a stock-dealer&mdash;in his gig, and they drew rein and exchanged
a few words.&nbsp; A part of the dealer&rsquo;s conversation had much
meaning for Nicholas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had occasion to call on Squire Everard,&rsquo;
the former said; &lsquo;but he couldn&rsquo;t see me on account of being
quite knocked up at some bad news he has heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas rode on past Froom-Everard to Elsenford Farm, pondering.&nbsp;
He had new and startling matter for thought as soon as he got there.&nbsp;
The Squire&rsquo;s note had arrived.&nbsp; At first he could not credit
its import; then he saw further, took in the tone of the letter, saw
the writer&rsquo;s contempt behind the words, and understood that the
letter was written as by a man hemmed into a corner.&nbsp; Christine
was defiantly&mdash;insultingly&mdash;hurled at his head.&nbsp; He was
accepted because he was so despised.</p>
<p>And yet with what respect he had treated her and hers!&nbsp; Now
he was reminded of what an agricultural friend had said years ago, seeing
the eyes of Nicholas fixed on Christine as on an angel when she passed:
&lsquo;Better a little fire to warm &rsquo;ee than a great one to burn
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; No good can come of throwing your heart there.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He went into the mead, sat down, and asked himself four questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; How could she live near her acquaintance as his wife, even
in his absence, without suffering martyrdom from the stings of their
contempt?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Would not this entail total estrangement between Christine
and her family also, and her own consequent misery?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Must not such isolation extinguish her affection for him?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Supposing that her father rigged them out as colonists and
sent them off to America, was not the effect of such exile upon one
of her gentle nurture likely to be as the last?</p>
<p>In short, whatever they should embark in together would be cruelty
to her, and his death would be a relief.&nbsp; It would, indeed, in
one aspect be a relief to her now, if she were so ashamed of him as
she had appeared to be that day.&nbsp; Were he dead, this little episode
with him would fade away like a dream.</p>
<p>Mr. Everard was a good-hearted man at bottom, but to take his enraged
offer seriously was impossible.&nbsp; Obviously it was hotly made in
his first bitterness at what he had heard.&nbsp; The least thing that
he could do would be to go away and never trouble her more.&nbsp; To
travel and learn and come back in two years, as mapped out in their
first sanguine scheme, required a staunch heart on her side, if the
necessary expenditure of time and money were to be afterwards justified;
and it were folly to calculate on that when he had seen to-day that
her heart was failing her already.&nbsp; To travel and disappear and
not be heard of for many years would be a far more independent stroke,
and it would leave her entirely unfettered.&nbsp; Perhaps he might rival
in this kind the accomplished Mr. Bellston, of whose journeyings he
had heard so much.</p>
<p>He sat and sat, and the fog rose out of the river, enveloping him
like a fleece; first his feet and knees, then his arms and body, and
finally submerging his head.&nbsp; When he had come to a decision he
went up again into the homestead.&nbsp; He would be independent, if
he died for it, and he would free Christine.&nbsp; Exile was the only
course.&nbsp; The first step was to inform his uncle of his determination.</p>
<p>Two days later Nicholas was on the same spot in the mead, at almost
the same hour of eve.&nbsp; But there was no fog now; a blusterous autumn
wind had ousted the still, golden days and misty nights; and he was
going, full of purpose, in the opposite direction.&nbsp; When he had
last entered the mead he was an inhabitant of the Froom valley; in forty-eight
hours he had severed himself from that spot as completely as if he had
never belonged to it.&nbsp; All that appertained to him in the Froom
valley now was circumscribed by the portmanteau in his hand.</p>
<p>In making his preparations for departure he had unconsciously held
a faint, foolish hope that she would communicate with him and make up
their estrangement in some soft womanly way.&nbsp; But she had given
no signal, and it was too evident to him that her latest mood had grown
to be her fixed one, proving how well founded had been his impulse to
set her free.</p>
<p>He entered the Sallows, found his way in the dark to the garden-door
of the house, slipped under it a note to tell her of his departure,
and explaining its true reason to be a consciousness of her growing
feeling that he was an encumbrance and a humiliation.&nbsp; Of the direction
of his journey and of the date of his return he said nothing.</p>
<p>His course now took him into the high road, which he pursued for
some miles in a north-easterly direction, still spinning the thread
of sad inferences, and asking himself why he should ever return.&nbsp;
At daybreak he stood on the hill above Shottsford-Forum, and awaited
a coach which passed about this time along that highway towards Melchester
and London.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>Some fifteen years after the date of the foregoing incidents, a man
who had dwelt in far countries, and viewed many cities, arrived at Roy-Town,
a roadside hamlet on the old western turnpike road, not five miles from
Froom-Everard, and put up at the Buck&rsquo;s Head, an isolated inn
at that spot.&nbsp; He was still barely of middle age, but it could
be seen that a haze of grey was settling upon the locks of his hair,
and that his face had lost colour and curve, as if by exposure to bleaching
climates and strange atmospheres, or from ailments incidental thereto.&nbsp;
He seemed to observe little around him, by reason of the intrusion of
his musings upon the scene.&nbsp; In truth Nicholas Long was just now
the creature of old hopes and fears consequent upon his arrival&mdash;this
man who once had not cared if his name were blotted out from that district.&nbsp;
The evening light showed wistful lines which he could not smooth away
by the worldling&rsquo;s gloss of nonchalance that he had learnt to
fling over his face.</p>
<p>The Buck&rsquo;s Head was a somewhat unusual place for a man of this
sort to choose as a house of sojourn in preference to some Casterbridge
inn four miles further on.&nbsp; Before he left home it had been a lively
old tavern at which High-flyers, and Heralds, and Tally-hoes had changed
horses on their stages up and down the country; but now the house was
rather cavernous and chilly, the stable-roofs were hollow-backed, the
landlord was asthmatic, and the traffic gone.</p>
<p>He arrived in the afternoon, and when he had sent back the fly and
was having a nondescript meal, he put a question to the waiting-maid
with a mien of indifference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Squire Everard, of Froom-Everard Manor, has been dead some
years, I believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are any of the family left there still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, bless you, sir!&nbsp; They sold the place years ago&mdash;Squire
Everard&rsquo;s son did&mdash;and went away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never
heard where they went to.&nbsp; They came quite to nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never heard anything of the young lady&mdash;the Squire&rsquo;s
daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; You see &rsquo;twas before I came to these parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the waitress left the room, Nicholas pushed aside his plate
and gazed out of the window.&nbsp; He was not going over into the Froom
Valley altogether on Christine&rsquo;s account, but she had greatly
animated his motive in coming that way.&nbsp; Anyhow he would push on
there now that he was so near, and not ask questions here where he was
liable to be wrongly informed.&nbsp; The fundamental inquiry he had
not ventured to make&mdash;whether Christine had married before the
family went away.&nbsp; He had abstained because of an absurd dread
of extinguishing hopeful surmise.&nbsp; That the Everards had left their
old home was bad enough intelligence for one day.</p>
<p>Rising from the table he put on his hat and went out, ascending towards
the upland which divided this district from his native vale.&nbsp; The
first familiar feature that met his eye was a little spot on the distant
sky&mdash;a clump of trees standing on a barrow which surmounted a yet
more remote upland&mdash;a point where, in his childhood, he had believed
people could stand and see America.&nbsp; He reached the further verge
of the plateau on which he had entered.&nbsp; Ah, there was the valley&mdash;a
greenish-grey stretch of colour&mdash;still looking placid and serene,
as though it had not much missed him.&nbsp; If Christine was no longer
there, why should he pause over it this evening?&nbsp; His uncle and
aunt were dead, and to-morrow would be soon enough to inquire for remoter
relatives.&nbsp; Thus, disinclined to go further, he turned to retrace
his way to the inn.</p>
<p>In the backward path he now perceived the figure of a woman, who
had been walking at a distance behind him; and as she drew nearer he
began to be startled.&nbsp; Surely, despite the variations introduced
into that figure by changing years, its ground-lines were those of Christine?</p>
<p>Nicholas had been sentimental enough to write to Christine immediately
on landing at Southampton a day or two before this, addressing his letter
at a venture to the old house, and merely telling her that he planned
to reach the Roy-Town inn on the present afternoon.&nbsp; The news of
the scattering of the Everards had dissipated his hope of hearing of
her; but here she was.</p>
<p>So they met&mdash;there, alone, on the open down by a pond, just
as if the meeting had been carefully arranged.</p>
<p>She threw up her veil.&nbsp; She was still beautiful, though the
years had touched her; a little more matronly&mdash;much more homely.&nbsp;
Or was it only that he was much less homely now&mdash;a man of the world&mdash;the
sense of homeliness being relative?&nbsp; Her face had grown to be pre-eminently
of the sort that would be called interesting.&nbsp; Her habiliments
were of a demure and sober cast, though she was one who had used to
dress so airily and so gaily.&nbsp; Years had laid on a few shadows
too in this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I received your letter,&rsquo; she said, when the momentary
embarrassment of their first approach had passed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I
thought I would walk across the hills to-day, as it was fine.&nbsp;
I have just called at the inn, and they told me you were out.&nbsp;
I was now on my way homeward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He hardly listened to this, though he intently gazed at her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Christine,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;one word.&nbsp; Are you free?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I am in a certain sense,&rsquo; she replied, colouring.</p>
<p>The announcement had a magical effect.&nbsp; The intervening time
between past and present closed up for him, and moved by an impulse
which he had combated for fifteen years, he seized her two hands and
drew her towards him.</p>
<p>She started back, and became almost a mere acquaintance.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have to tell you,&rsquo; she gasped, &lsquo;that I have&mdash;been married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas&rsquo;s rose-coloured dream was immediately toned down to
a greyish tinge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not marry till many years after you had left,&rsquo;
she continued in the humble tones of one confessing to a crime.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh Nic,&rsquo; she cried reproachfully, &lsquo;how could you
stay away so long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom did you marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bellston.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;ought to have expected it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was going
to add, &lsquo;And is he dead?&rsquo; but he checked himself.&nbsp;
Her dress unmistakably suggested widowhood; and she had said she was
free.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must now hasten home,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I felt
that, considering my shortcomings at our parting so many years ago,
I owed you the initiative now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is some of your old generosity in that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
walk with you, if I may.&nbsp; Where are you living, Christine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the same house, but not on the old conditions.&nbsp; I
have part of it on lease; the farmer now tenanting the premises found
the whole more than he wanted, and the owner allowed me to keep what
rooms I chose.&nbsp; I am poor now, you know, Nicholas, and almost friendless.&nbsp;
My brother sold the Froom-Everard estate when it came to him, and the
person who bought it turned our home into a farmhouse.&nbsp; Till my
father&rsquo;s death my husband and I lived in the manor-house with
him, so that I have never lived away from the spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was poor.&nbsp; That, and the change of name, sufficiently accounted
for the inn-servant&rsquo;s ignorance of her continued existence within
the walls of her old home.</p>
<p>It was growing dusk, and he still walked with her.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s
head arose from the declivity before them, and as she drew nearer, Christine
asked him to go back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the wife of the farmer who shares the house,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is accustomed to come out and meet me whenever
I walk far and am benighted.&nbsp; I am obliged to walk everywhere now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s wife, seeing that Christine was not alone, paused
in her advance, and Nicholas said, &lsquo;Dear Christine, if you are
obliged to do these things, I am not, and what wealth I can command
you may command likewise.&nbsp; They say rolling stones gather no moss;
but they gather dross sometimes.&nbsp; I was one of the pioneers to
the gold-fields, you know, and made a sufficient fortune there for my
wants.&nbsp; What is more, I kept it.&nbsp; When I had done this I was
coming home, but hearing of my uncle&rsquo;s death I changed my plan,
travelled, speculated, and increased my fortune.&nbsp; Now, before we
part: you remember you stood with me at the altar once, and therefore
I speak with less preparation than I should otherwise use.&nbsp; Before
we part then I ask, shall another again intrude between us?&nbsp; Or
shall we complete the union we began?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She trembled&mdash;just as she had done at that very minute of standing
with him in the church, to which he had recalled her mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
will not enter into that now, dear Nicholas,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There will be more to talk of and consider first&mdash;more to
explain, which it would have spoiled this meeting to have entered into
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Further than the brief answer I first gave, Nic, don&rsquo;t
press me to-night.&nbsp; I still have the old affection for you, or
I should not have sought you.&nbsp; Let that suffice for the moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, dear one.&nbsp; And when shall I call to see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will write and fix an hour.&nbsp; I will tell you everything
of my history then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thus they parted, Nicholas feeling that he had not come here
fruitlessly.&nbsp; When she and her companion were out of sight he retraced
his steps to Roy-Town, where he made himself as comfortable as he could
in the deserted old inn of his boyhood&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; He missed
her companionship this evening more than he had done at any time during
the whole fifteen years; and it was as though instead of separation
there had been constant communion with her throughout that period.&nbsp;
The tones of her voice had stirred his heart in a nook which had lain
stagnant ever since he last heard them.&nbsp; They recalled the woman
to whom he had once lifted his eyes as to a goddess.&nbsp; Her announcement
that she had been another&rsquo;s came as a little shock to him, and
he did not now lift his eyes to her in precisely the same way as he
had lifted them at first.&nbsp; But he forgave her for marrying Bellston;
what could he expect after fifteen years?</p>
<p>He slept at Roy-Town that night, and in the morning there was a short
note from her, repeating more emphatically her statement of the previous
evening&mdash;that she wished to inform him clearly of her circumstances,
and to calmly consider with him the position in which she was placed.&nbsp;
Would he call upon her on Sunday afternoon, when she was sure to be
alone?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nic,&rsquo; she wrote on, &lsquo;what a cosmopolite you are!&nbsp;
I expected to find my old yeoman still; but I was quite awed in the
presence of such a citizen of the world.&nbsp; Did I seem rusty and
unpractised?&nbsp; Ah&mdash;you seemed so once to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tender playful words; the old Christine was in them.&nbsp; She said
Sunday afternoon, and it was now only Saturday morning.&nbsp; He wished
she had said to-day; that short revival of her image had vitalized to
sudden heat feelings that had almost been stilled.&nbsp; Whatever she
might have to explain as to her position&mdash;and it was awkwardly
narrowed, no doubt&mdash;he could not give her up.&nbsp; Miss Everard
or Mrs. Bellston, what mattered it?&mdash;she was the same Christine.</p>
<p>He did not go outside the inn all Saturday.&nbsp; He had no wish
to see or do anything but to await the coming interview.&nbsp; So he
smoked, and read the local newspaper of the previous week, and stowed
himself in the chimney-corner.&nbsp; In the evening he felt that he
could remain indoors no longer, and the moon being near the full, he
started from the inn on foot in the same direction as that of yesterday,
with the view of contemplating the old village and its precincts, and
hovering round her house under the cloak of night.</p>
<p>With a stout stick in his hand he climbed over the five miles of
upland in a comparatively short space of time.&nbsp; Nicholas had seen
many strange lands and trodden many strange ways since he last walked
that path, but as he trudged he seemed wonderfully like his old self,
and had not the slightest difficulty in finding the way.&nbsp; In descending
to the meads the streams perplexed him a little, some of the old foot-bridges
having been removed; but he ultimately got across the larger water-courses,
and pushed on to the village, avoiding her residence for the moment,
lest she should encounter him, and think he had not respected the time
of her appointment.</p>
<p>He found his way to the churchyard, and first ascertained where lay
the two relations he had left alive at his departure; then he observed
the gravestones of other inhabitants with whom he had been well acquainted,
till by degrees he seemed to be in the society of all the elder Froom-Everard
population, as he had known the place.&nbsp; Side by side as they had
lived in his day here were they now.&nbsp; They had moved house in mass.</p>
<p>But no tomb of Mr. Bellston was visible, though, as he had lived
at the manor-house, it would have been natural to find it here.&nbsp;
In truth Nicholas was more anxious to discover that than anything, being
curious to know how long he had been dead.&nbsp; Seeing from the glimmer
of a light in the church that somebody was there cleaning for Sunday
he entered, and looked round upon the walls as well as he could.&nbsp;
But there was no monument to her husband, though one had been erected
to the Squire.</p>
<p>Nicholas addressed the young man who was sweeping.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t see any monument or tomb to the late Mr. Bellston?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, sir; you won&rsquo;t see that,&rsquo; said the young
man drily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, pray?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s not buried here.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not Christian-buried
anywhere, as far as we know.&nbsp; In short, perhaps he&rsquo;s not
buried at all; and between ourselves, perhaps he&rsquo;s alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas sank an inch shorter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know the peculiar circumstances, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a stranger here&mdash;as to late years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bellston was a traveller&mdash;an explorer&mdash;it was
his calling; you may have heard his name as such?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nicholas recalled the fact that this
very bent of Mr. Bellston&rsquo;s was the incentive to his own roaming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, when he married he came and lived here with his wife
and his wife&rsquo;s father, and said he would travel no more.&nbsp;
But after a time he got weary of biding quiet here, and weary of her&mdash;he
was not a good husband to the young lady by any means&mdash;and he betook
himself again to his old trick of roving&mdash;with her money.&nbsp;
Away he went, quite out of the realm of human foot, into the bowels
of Asia, and never was heard of more.&nbsp; He was murdered, it is said,
but nobody knows; though as that was nine years ago he&rsquo;s dead
enough in principle, if not in corporation.&nbsp; His widow lives quite
humble, for between her husband and her brother she&rsquo;s left in
very lean pasturage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas went back to the Buck&rsquo;s Head without hovering round
her dwelling.&nbsp; This then was the explanation which she had wanted
to make.&nbsp; Not dead, but missing.&nbsp; How could he have expected
that the first fair promise of happiness held out to him would remain
untarnished?&nbsp; She had said that she was free; and legally she was
free, no doubt.&nbsp; Moreover, from her tone and manner he felt himself
justified in concluding that she would be willing to run the risk of
a union with him, in the improbability of her husband&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp;
Even if that husband lived, his return was not a likely event, to judge
from his character.&nbsp; A man who could spend her money on his own
personal adventures would not be anxious to disturb her poverty after
such a lapse of time.</p>
<p>Well, the prospect was not so unclouded as it had seemed.&nbsp; But
could he, even now, give up Christine?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>Two months more brought the year nearly to a close, and found Nicholas
Long tenant of a spacious house in the market-town nearest to Froom-Everard.&nbsp;
A man of means, genial character, and a bachelor, he was an object of
great interest to his neighbours, and to his neighbours&rsquo; wives
and daughters.&nbsp; But he took little note of this, and had made it
his business to go twice a week, no matter what the weather, to the
now farmhouse at Froom-Everard, a wing of which had been retained as
the refuge of Christine.&nbsp; He always walked, to give no trouble
in putting up a horse to a housekeeper whose staff was limited.</p>
<p>The two had put their heads together on the situation, had gone to
a solicitor, had balanced possibilities, and had resolved to make the
plunge of matrimony.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing venture, nothing have,&rsquo;
Christine had said, with some of her old audacity.</p>
<p>With almost gratuitous honesty they had let their intentions be widely
known.&nbsp; Christine, it is true, had rather shrunk from publicity
at first; but Nicholas argued that their boldness in this respect would
have good results.&nbsp; With his friends he held that there was not
the slightest probability of her being other than a widow, and a challenge
to the missing man now, followed by no response, would stultify any
unpleasant remarks which might be thrown at her after their union.&nbsp;
To this end a paragraph was inserted in the Wessex papers, announcing
that their marriage was proposed to be celebrated on such and such a
day in December.</p>
<p>His periodic walks along the south side of the valley to visit her
were among the happiest experiences of his life.&nbsp; The yellow leaves
falling around him in the foreground, the well-watered meads on the
left hand, and the woman he loved awaiting him at the back of the scene,
promised a future of much serenity, as far as human judgment could foresee.&nbsp;
On arriving, he would sit with her in the &lsquo;parlour&rsquo; of the
wing she retained, her general sitting-room, where the only relics of
her early surroundings were an old clock from the other end of the house,
and her own piano.&nbsp; Before it was quite dark they would stand,
hand in hand, looking out of the window across the flat turf to the
dark clump of trees which hid further view from their eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you wish you were still mistress here, dear?&rsquo; he
once said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said she cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
a good enough room, and a good enough fire, and a good enough friend.&nbsp;
Besides, my latter days as mistress of the house were not happy ones,
and they spoilt the place for me.&nbsp; It was a punishment for my faithlessness.&nbsp;
Nic, you do forgive me?&nbsp; Really you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The twenty-third of December, the eve of the wedding-day, had arrived
at last in the train of such uneventful ones as these.&nbsp; Nicholas
had arranged to visit her that day a little later than usual, and see
that everything was ready with her for the morrow&rsquo;s event and
her removal to his house; for he had begun to look after her domestic
affairs, and to lighten as much as possible the duties of her housekeeping.</p>
<p>He was to come to an early supper, which she had arranged to take
the place of a wedding-breakfast next day&mdash;the latter not being
feasible in her present situation.&nbsp; An hour or so after dark the
wife of the farmer who lived in the other part of the house entered
Christine&rsquo;s parlour to lay the cloth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What with getting the ham skinned, and the black-puddings
hotted up,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it will take me all my time before
he&rsquo;s here, if I begin this minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay the table myself,&rsquo; said Christine, jumping
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you attend to the cooking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; And perhaps &rsquo;tis no matter,
seeing that it is the last night you&rsquo;ll have to do such work.&nbsp;
I knew this sort of life wouldn&rsquo;t last long for &rsquo;ee, being
born to better things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has lasted rather long, Mrs. Wake.&nbsp; And if he had
not found me out it would have lasted all my days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he did find you out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll lay the cloth immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wake went back to the kitchen, and Christine began to bustle
about.&nbsp; She greatly enjoyed preparing this table for Nicholas and
herself with her own hands.&nbsp; She took artistic pleasure in adjusting
each article to its position, as if half an inch error were a point
of high importance.&nbsp; Finally she placed the two candles where they
were to stand, and sat down by the fire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wake re-entered and regarded the effect.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not
have another candle or two, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twould
make it livelier.&nbsp; Say four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Christine, and four candles were lighted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; she added, surveying them, &lsquo;I have been
now so long accustomed to little economies that they look quite extravagant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ll soon think nothing of forty in his grand
new house!&nbsp; Shall I bring in supper directly he comes, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not for half an hour; and, Mrs. Wake, you and Betsy are
busy in the kitchen, I know; so when he knocks don&rsquo;t disturb yourselves;
I can let him in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was again left alone, and, as it still wanted some time to Nicholas&rsquo;s
appointment, she stood by the fire, looking at herself in the glass
over the mantel.&nbsp; Reflectively raising a lock of her hair just
above her temple she uncovered a small scar.&nbsp; That scar had a history.&nbsp;
The terrible temper of her late husband&mdash;those sudden moods of
irascibility which had made even his friendly excitements look like
anger&mdash;had once caused him to set that mark upon her with the bezel
of a ring he wore.&nbsp; He declared that the whole thing was an accident.&nbsp;
She was a woman, and kept her own opinion.</p>
<p>Christine then turned her back to the glass and scanned the table
and the candles, shining one at each corner like types of the four Evangelists,
and thought they looked too assuming&mdash;too confident.&nbsp; She
glanced up at the clock, which stood also in this room, there not being
space enough for it in the passage.&nbsp; It was nearly seven, and she
expected Nicholas at half-past.&nbsp; She liked the company of this
venerable article in her lonely life: its tickings and whizzings were
a sort of conversation.&nbsp; It now began to strike the hour.&nbsp;
At the end something grated slightly.&nbsp; Then, without any warning,
the clock slowly inclined forward and fell at full length upon the floor.</p>
<p>The crash brought the farmer&rsquo;s wife rushing into the room.&nbsp;
Christine had well-nigh sprung out of her shoes.&nbsp; Mrs. Wake&rsquo;s
enquiry what had happened was answered by the evidence of her own eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did it occur?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say; it was not firmly fixed, I suppose.&nbsp; Dear
me, how sorry I am!&nbsp; My dear father&rsquo;s hall-clock!&nbsp; And
now I suppose it is ruined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Assisted by Mrs. Wake, she lifted the clock.&nbsp; Every inch of
glass was, of course, shattered, but very little harm besides appeared
to be done.&nbsp; They propped it up temporarily, though it would not
go again.</p>
<p>Christine had soon recovered her composure, but she saw that Mrs.
Wake was gloomy.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does it mean, Mrs. Wake?&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it ominous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a sign of a violent death in the family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe such things;
and don&rsquo;t mention it to Mr. Long when he comes.&nbsp; <i>He&rsquo;s</i>
not in the family yet, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, it cannot refer to him,&rsquo; said Mrs. Wake musingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some remote cousin, perhaps,&rsquo; observed Christine, no
less willing to humour her than to get rid of a shapeless dread which
the incident had caused in her own mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;And&mdash;supper
is almost ready, Mrs. Wake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In three-quarters of an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wake left the room, and Christine sat on.&nbsp; Though it still
wanted fifteen minutes to the hour at which Nicholas had promised to
be there, she began to grow impatient.&nbsp; After the accustomed ticking
the dead silence was oppressive.&nbsp; But she had not to wait so long
as she had expected; steps were heard approaching the door, and there
was a knock.</p>
<p>Christine was already there to open it.&nbsp; The entrance had no
lamp, but it was not particularly dark out of doors.&nbsp; She could
see the outline of a man, and cried cheerfully, &lsquo;You are early;
it is very good of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg pardon.&nbsp; It is not Mr. Bellston himself&mdash;only
a messenger with his bag and great-coat.&nbsp; But he will be here soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice was not the voice of Nicholas, and the intelligence was
strange.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Mr. Bellston?&rsquo;
she faintly replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; A gentleman&mdash;a stranger to me&mdash;gave
me these things at Casterbridge station to bring on here, and told me
to say that Mr. Bellston had arrived there, and is detained for half-an-hour,
but will be here in the course of the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sank into a chair.&nbsp; The porter put a small battered portmanteau
on the floor, the coat on a chair, and looking into the room at the
spread table said, &lsquo;If you are disappointed, ma&rsquo;am, that
your husband (as I s&rsquo;pose he is) is not come, I can assure you
he&rsquo;ll soon be here.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s stopped to get a shave, to
my thinking, seeing he wanted it.&nbsp; What he said was that I could
tell you he had heard the news in Ireland, and would have come sooner,
his hand being forced; but was hindered crossing by the weather, having
took passage in a sailing vessel.&nbsp; What news he meant he didn&rsquo;t
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; she faltered.&nbsp; It was plain that the
man knew nothing of her intended re-marriage.</p>
<p>Mechanically rising and giving him a shilling, she answered to his
&lsquo;good-night,&rsquo; and he withdrew, the beat of his footsteps
lessening in the distance.&nbsp; She was alone; but in what a solitude.</p>
<p>Christine stood in the middle of the hall, just as the man had left
her, in the gloomy silence of the stopped clock within the adjoining
room, till she aroused herself, and turning to the portmanteau and great-coat
brought them to the light of the candles, and examined them.&nbsp; The
portmanteau bore painted upon it the initials &lsquo;J. B.&rsquo; in
white letters&mdash;the well-known initials of her husband.</p>
<p>She examined the great-coat.&nbsp; In the breast-pocket was an empty
spirit flask, which she firmly fancied she recognized as the one she
had filled many times for him when he was living at home with her.</p>
<p>She turned desultorily hither and thither, until she heard another
tread without, and there came a second knocking at the door.&nbsp; She
did not respond to it; and Nicholas&mdash;for it was he&mdash;thinking
that he was not heard by reason of a concentration on to-morrow&rsquo;s
proceedings, opened the door softly, and came on to the door of her
room, which stood unclosed, just as it had been left by the Casterbridge
porter.</p>
<p>Nicholas uttered a blithe greeting, cast his eye round the parlour,
which with its tall candles, blazing fire, snow-white cloth, and prettily-spread
table, formed a cheerful spectacle enough for a man who had been walking
in the dark for an hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My bride&mdash;almost, at last!&rsquo; he cried, encircling
her with his arms.</p>
<p>Instead of responding, her figure became limp, frigid, heavy; her
head fell back, and he found that she had fainted.</p>
<p>It was natural, he thought.&nbsp; She had had many little worrying
matters to attend to, and but slight assistance.&nbsp; He ought to have
seen more effectually to her affairs; the closeness of the event had
over-excited her.&nbsp; Nicholas kissed her unconscious face&mdash;more
than once, little thinking what news it was that had changed its aspect.&nbsp;
Loth to call Mrs. Wake, he carried Christine to a couch and laid her
down.&nbsp; This had the effect of reviving her.&nbsp; Nicholas bent
and whispered in her ear, &lsquo;Lie quiet, dearest, no hurry; and dream,
dream, dream of happy days.&nbsp; It is only I.&nbsp; You will soon
be better.&rsquo;&nbsp; He held her by the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; she said, with a stare.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
how can this be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas was alarmed and perplexed, but the disclosure was not long
delayed.&nbsp; When she had sat up, and by degrees made the stunning
event known to him, he stood as if transfixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;is it so?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; Then, becoming quite
meek, &lsquo;And why was he so cruel as to&mdash;delay his return till
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dutifully recited the explanation her husband had given her through
the messenger; but her mechanical manner of telling it showed how much
she doubted its truth.&nbsp; It was too unlikely that his arrival at
such a dramatic moment should not be a contrived surprise, quite of
a piece with his previous dealings towards her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But perhaps it may be true&mdash;and he may have become kind
now&mdash;not as he used to be,&rsquo; she faltered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
perhaps, Nicholas, he is an altered man&mdash;we&rsquo;ll hope he is.&nbsp;
I suppose I ought not to have listened to my legal advisers, and assumed
his death so surely!&nbsp; Anyhow, I am roughly received back into&mdash;the
right way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas burst out bitterly: &lsquo;O what too, too honest fools
we were!&mdash;to so court daylight upon our intention by putting that
announcement in the papers!&nbsp; Why could we not have married privately,
and gone away, so that he would never have known what had become of
you, even if he had returned?&nbsp; Christine, he has done it to . .
. But I&rsquo;ll say no more.&nbsp; Of course we&mdash;might fly now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; we might not,&rsquo; said she hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; But this is hard to bear!&nbsp; &ldquo;When
I looked for good then evil came unto me, and when I waited for light
there came darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; So once said a sorely tried man in
the land of Uz, and so say I now! . . . I wonder if he is almost here
at this moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told him she supposed Bellston was approaching by the path across
the fields, having sent on his great-coat, which he would not want walking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is this meal laid for him, or for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was laid for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it will be eaten by him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christine, are you <i>sure</i> that he is come, or have you
been sleeping over the fire and dreaming it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pointed anew to the portmanteau with the initials &lsquo;J. B.,&rsquo;
and to the coat beside it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, good-bye&mdash;good-bye!&nbsp; Curse that parson for
not marrying us fifteen years ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell further upon that parting.&nbsp; There
are scenes wherein the words spoken do not even approximate to the level
of the mental communion between the actors.&nbsp; Suffice it to say
that part they did, and quickly; and Nicholas, more dead than alive,
went out of the house homewards.</p>
<p>Why had he ever come back?&nbsp; During his absence he had not cared
for Christine as he cared now.&nbsp; If he had been younger he might
have felt tempted to descend into the meads instead of keeping along
their edge.&nbsp; The Froom was down there, and he knew of quiet pools
in that stream to which death would come easily.&nbsp; But he was too
old to put an end to himself for such a reason as love; and another
thought, too, kept him from seriously contemplating any desperate act.&nbsp;
His affection for her was strongly protective, and in the event of her
requiring a friend&rsquo;s support in future troubles there was none
but himself left in the world to afford it.&nbsp; So he walked on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Christine had resigned herself to circumstances.&nbsp;
A resolve to continue worthy of her history and of her family lent her
heroism and dignity.&nbsp; She called Mrs. Wake, and explained to that
worthy woman as much of what had occurred as she deemed necessary.&nbsp;
Mrs. Wake was too amazed to reply; she retreated slowly, her lips parted;
till at the door she said with a dry mouth, &lsquo;And the beautiful
supper, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serve it when he comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Mr. Bellston&mdash;yes, ma&rsquo;am, I will.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She still stood gazing, as if she could hardly take in the order.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do, Mrs. Wake.&nbsp; I am much obliged to you for
all your kindness.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Christine was left alone again,
and then she wept.</p>
<p>She sat down and waited.&nbsp; That awful silence of the stopped
clock began anew, but she did not mind it now.&nbsp; She was listening
for a footfall in a state of mental tensity which almost took away from
her the power of motion.&nbsp; It seemed to her that the natural interval
for her husband&rsquo;s journey thither must have expired; but she was
not sure, and waited on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wake again came in.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have not rung for supper&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not yet come, Mrs. Wake.&nbsp; If you want to go to
bed, bring in the supper and set it on the table.&nbsp; It will be nearly
as good cold.&nbsp; Leave the door unbarred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wake did as was suggested, made up the fire, and went away.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards Christine heard her retire to her chamber.&nbsp;
But Christine still sat on, and still her husband postponed his entry.</p>
<p>She aroused herself once or twice to freshen the fire, but was ignorant
how the night was going.&nbsp; Her watch was upstairs and she did not
make the effort to go up to consult it.&nbsp; In her seat she continued;
and still the supper waited, and still he did not come.</p>
<p>At length she was so nearly persuaded that the arrival of his things
must have been a dream after all, that she again went over to them,
felt them, and examined them.&nbsp; His they unquestionably were; and
their forwarding by the porter had been quite natural.&nbsp; She sighed
and sat down again.</p>
<p>Presently she fell into a doze, and when she again became conscious
she found that the four candles had burnt into their sockets and gone
out.&nbsp; The fire still emitted a feeble shine.&nbsp; Christine did
not take the trouble to get more candles, but stirred the fire and sat
on.</p>
<p>After a long period she heard a creaking of the chamber floor and
stairs at the other end of the house, and knew that the farmer&rsquo;s
family were getting up.&nbsp; By-and-by Mrs. Wake entered the room,
candle in hand, bouncing open the door in her morning manner, obviously
without any expectation of finding a person there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord-a-mercy!&nbsp; What, sitting here again, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am sitting here still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been there ever since last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t come at this time o&rsquo; morning,&rsquo;
said the farmer&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do &rsquo;ee get on to bed,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; You must be shrammed to death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to Christine now that possibly her husband had thought
better of obtruding himself upon her company within an hour of revealing
his existence to her, and had decided to pay a more formal visit next
day.&nbsp; She therefore adopted Mrs. Wake&rsquo;s suggestion and retired.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p>Nicholas had gone straight home, neither speaking to nor seeing a
soul.&nbsp; From that hour a change seemed to come over him.&nbsp; He
had ever possessed a full share of self-consciousness; he had been readily
piqued, had shown an unusual dread of being personally obtrusive.&nbsp;
But now his sense of self, as an individual provoking opinion, appeared
to leave him.&nbsp; When, therefore, after a day or two of seclusion,
he came forth again, and the few acquaintances he had formed in the
town condoled with him on what had happened, and pitied his haggard
looks, he did not shrink from their regard as he would have done formerly,
but took their sympathy as it would have been accepted by a child.</p>
<p>It reached his ears that Bellston had not appeared on the evening
of his arrival at any hotel in the town or neighbourhood, or entered
his wife&rsquo;s house at all.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a part of his
cruelty,&rsquo; thought Nicholas.&nbsp; And when two or three days had
passed, and still no account came to him of Bellston having joined her,
he ventured to set out for Froom-Everard.</p>
<p>Christine was so shaken that she was obliged to receive him as she
lay on a sofa, beside the square table which was to have borne their
evening feast.&nbsp; She fixed her eyes wistfully upon him, and smiled
a sad smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not come?&rsquo; said Nicholas under his breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Nicholas sat beside her, and they talked on general topics merely
like saddened old friends.&nbsp; But they could not keep away the subject
of Bellston, their voices dropping as it forced its way in.&nbsp; Christine,
no less than Nicholas, knowing her husband&rsquo;s character, inferred
that, having stopped her game, as he would have phrased it, he was taking
things leisurely, and, finding nothing very attractive in her limited
mode of living, was meaning to return to her only when he had nothing
better to do.</p>
<p>The bolt which laid low their hopes had struck so recently that they
could hardly look each other in the face when speaking that day.&nbsp;
But when a week or two had passed, and all the horizon still remained
as vacant of Bellston as before, Nicholas and she could talk of the
event with calm wonderment.&nbsp; Why had he come, to go again like
this?</p>
<p>And then there set in a period of resigned surmise, during which</p>
<blockquote><p>So like, so very like, was day to day,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that to tell of one of them is to tell of all.&nbsp; Nicholas would
arrive between three and four in the afternoon, a faint trepidation
influencing his walk as he neared her door.&nbsp; He would knock; she
would always reply in person, having watched for him from the window.&nbsp;
Then he would whisper&mdash;&lsquo;He has not come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not,&rsquo; she would say.</p>
<p>Nicholas would enter then, and she being ready bonneted, they would
walk into the Sallows together as far as to the spot which they had
frequently made their place of appointment in their youthful days.&nbsp;
A plank bridge, which Bellston had caused to be thrown over the stream
during his residence with her in the manor-house, was now again removed,
and all was just the same as in Nicholas&rsquo;s time, when he had been
accustomed to wade across on the edge of the cascade and come up to
her like a merman from the deep.&nbsp; Here on the felled trunk, which
still lay rotting in its old place, they would now sit, gazing at the
descending sheet of water, with its never-ending sarcastic hiss at their
baffled attempts to make themselves one flesh.&nbsp; Returning to the
house they would sit down together to tea, after which, and the confidential
chat that accompanied it, he walked home by the declining light.&nbsp;
This proceeding became as periodic as an astronomical recurrence.&nbsp;
Twice a week he came&mdash;all through that winter, all through the
spring following, through the summer, through the autumn, the next winter,
the next year, and the next, till an appreciable span of human life
had passed by.&nbsp; Bellston still tarried.</p>
<p>Years and years Nic walked that way, at this interval of three days,
from his house in the neighbouring town; and in every instance the aforesaid
order of things was customary; and still on his arrival the form of
words went on&mdash;&lsquo;He has not come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they grew older.&nbsp; The dim shape of that third one stood continually
between them; they could not displace it; neither, on the other hand,
could it effectually part them.&nbsp; They were in close communion,
yet not indissolubly united; lovers, yet never growing cured of love.&nbsp;
By the time that the fifth year of Nic&rsquo;s visiting had arrived,
on about the five-hundredth occasion of his presence at her tea-table,
he noticed that the bleaching process which had begun upon his own locks
was also spreading to hers.&nbsp; He told her so, and they laughed.&nbsp;
Yet she was in good health: a condition of suspense, which would have
half-killed a man, had been endured by her without complaint, and even
with composure.</p>
<p>One day, when these years of abeyance had numbered seven, they had
strolled as usual as far as the waterfall, whose faint roar formed a
sort of calling voice sufficient in the circumstances to direct their
listlessness.&nbsp; Pausing there, he looked up at her face and said,
&lsquo;Why should we not try again, Christine?&nbsp; We are legally
at liberty to do so now.&nbsp; Nothing venture nothing have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she would not.&nbsp; Perhaps a little primness of idea was by
this time ousting the native daring of Christine.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
he has done once he can do twice,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is
not dead, and if we were to marry he would say we had &ldquo;forced
his hand,&rdquo; as he said before, and duly reappear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some years after, when Christine was about fifty, and Nicholas fifty-three,
a new trouble of a minor kind arrived.&nbsp; He found an inconvenience
in traversing the distance between their two houses, particularly in
damp weather, the years he had spent in trying climates abroad having
sown the seeds of rheumatism, which made a journey undesirable on inclement
days, even in a carriage.&nbsp; He told her of this new difficulty,
as he did of everything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you could live nearer,&rsquo; suggested she.</p>
<p>Unluckily there was no house near.&nbsp; But Nicholas, though not
a millionaire, was a man of means; he obtained a small piece of ground
on lease at the nearest spot to her home that it could be so obtained,
which was on the opposite brink of the Froom, this river forming the
boundary of the Froom-Everard manor; and here he built a cottage large
enough for his wants.&nbsp; This took time, and when he got into it
he found its situation a great comfort to him.&nbsp; He was not more
than five hundred yards from her now, and gained a new pleasure in feeling
that all sounds which greeted his ears, in the day or in the night,
also fell upon hers&mdash;the caw of a particular rook, the voice of
a neighbouring nightingale, the whistle of a local breeze, or the purl
of the fall in the meadows, whose rush was a material rendering of Time&rsquo;s
ceaseless scour over themselves, wearing them away without uniting them.</p>
<p>Christine&rsquo;s missing husband was taking shape as a myth among
the surrounding residents; but he was still believed in as corporeally
imminent by Christine herself, and also, in a milder degree, by Nicholas.&nbsp;
For a curious unconsciousness of the long lapse of time since his revelation
of himself seemed to affect the pair.&nbsp; There had been no passing
events to serve as chronological milestones, and the evening on which
she had kept supper waiting for him still loomed out with startling
nearness in their retrospects.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth pensive year of this their parallel march towards
the common bourne, a labourer came in a hurry one day to Nicholas&rsquo;s
house and brought strange tidings.&nbsp; The present owner of Froom-Everard&mdash;a
non-resident&mdash;had been improving his property in sundry ways, and
one of these was by dredging the stream which, in the course of years,
had become choked with mud and weeds in its passage through the Sallows.&nbsp;
The process necessitated a reconstruction of the waterfall.&nbsp; When
the river had been pumped dry for this purpose, the skeleton of a man
had been found jammed among the piles supporting the edge of the fall.&nbsp;
Every particle of his flesh and clothing had been eaten by fishes or
abraded to nothing by the water, but the relics of a gold watch remained,
and on the inside of the case was engraved the name of the maker of
her husband&rsquo;s watch, which she well remembered.</p>
<p>Nicholas, deeply agitated, hastened down to the place and examined
the remains attentively, afterwards going across to Christine, and breaking
the discovery to her.&nbsp; She would not come to view the skeleton,
which lay extended on the grass, not a finger or toe-bone missing, so
neatly had the aquatic operators done their work.&nbsp; Conjecture was
directed to the question how Bellston had got there; and conjecture
alone could give an explanation.</p>
<p>It was supposed that, on his way to call upon her, he had taken a
short cut through the grounds, with which he was naturally very familiar,
and coming to the fall under the trees had expected to find there the
plank which, during his occupancy of the premises with Christine and
her father, he had placed there for crossing into the meads on the other
side instead of wading across as Nicholas had done.&nbsp; Before discovering
its removal he had probably overbalanced himself, and was thus precipitated
into the cascade, the piles beneath the descending current wedging him
between them like the prongs of a pitchfork, and effectually preventing
the rising of his body, over which the weeds grew.&nbsp; Such was the
reasonable supposition concerning the discovery; but proof was never
forthcoming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To think,&rsquo; said Nicholas, when the remains had been
decently interred, and he was again sitting with Christine&mdash;though
not beside the waterfall&mdash;&lsquo;to think how we visited him!&nbsp;
How we sat over him, hours and hours, gazing at him, bewailing our fate,
when all the time he was ironically hissing at us from the spot, in
an unknown tongue, that we could marry if we chose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She echoed the sentiment with a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have strange fancies,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose
it <i>must</i> have been my husband who came back, and not some other
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas felt that there was little doubt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides&mdash;the
skeleton,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . If it could not have been another person&rsquo;s&mdash;but
no, of course it was he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have married me on the day we had fixed, and there
would have been no impediment.&nbsp; You would now have been seventeen
years my wife, and we might have had tall sons and daughters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might have been so,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;is it still better late than never?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question was one which had become complicated by the increasing
years of each.&nbsp; Their wills were somewhat enfeebled now, their
hearts sickened of tender enterprise by hope too long deferred.&nbsp;
Having postponed the consideration of their course till a year after
the interment of Bellston, each seemed less disposed than formerly to
take it up again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it worth while, after so many years?&rsquo; she said to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are fairly happy as we are&mdash;perhaps happier
than we should be in any other relation, seeing what old people we have
grown.&nbsp; The weight is gone from our lives; the shadow no longer
divides us: then let us be joyful together as we are, dearest Nic, in
the days of our vanity; and</p>
<blockquote><p>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He fell in with these views of hers to some extent.&nbsp; But occasionally
he ventured to urge her to reconsider the case, though he spoke not
with the fervour of his earlier years.</p>
<p><i>Autumn</i>, 1887.</p>
<h2>ALICIA&rsquo;S DIARY</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;SHE MISSES HER SISTER</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;I wander about the house in a mood of unutterable
sadness, for my dear sister Caroline has left home to-day with my mother,
and I shall not see them again for several weeks.&nbsp; They have accepted
a long-standing invitation to visit some old friends of ours, the Marlets,
who live at Versailles for cheapness&mdash;my mother thinking that it
will be for the good of Caroline to see a little of France and Paris.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t quite like her going.&nbsp; I fear she may lose some
of that childlike simplicity and gentleness which so characterize her,
and have been nourished by the seclusion of our life here.&nbsp; Her
solicitude about her pony before starting was quite touching, and she
made me promise to visit it daily, and see that it came to no harm.</p>
<p>Caroline gone abroad, and I left here!&nbsp; It is the reverse of
an ordinary situation, for good or ill-luck has mostly ordained that
I should be the absent one.&nbsp; Mother will be quite tired out by
the young enthusiasm of Caroline.&nbsp; She will demand to be taken
everywhere&mdash;to Paris continually, of course; to all the stock shrines
of history&rsquo;s devotees; to palaces and prisons; to kings&rsquo;
tombs and queens&rsquo; tombs; to cemeteries and picture-galleries,
and royal hunting forests.&nbsp; My poor mother, having gone over most
of this ground many times before, will perhaps not find the perambulation
so exhilarating as will Caroline herself.&nbsp; I wish I could have
gone with them.&nbsp; I would not have minded having my legs walked
off to please Caroline.&nbsp; But this regret is absurd: I could not,
of course, leave my father with not a soul in the house to attend to
the calls of the parishioners or to pour out his tea.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;A letter from Caroline to-day.&nbsp; It is
very strange that she tells me nothing which I expected her to tell&mdash;only
trivial details.&nbsp; She seems dazzled by the brilliancy of Paris&mdash;which
no doubt appears still more brilliant to her from the fact of her only
being able to obtain occasional glimpses of it.&nbsp; She would see
that Paris, too, has a seamy side if you live there.&nbsp; I was not
aware that the Marlets knew so many people.&nbsp; If, as mother has
said, they went to reside at Versailles for reasons of economy, they
will not effect much in that direction while they make a practice of
entertaining all the acquaintances who happen to be in their neighbourhood.&nbsp;
They do not confine their hospitalities to English people, either.&nbsp;
I wonder who this M. de la Feste is, in whom Caroline says my mother
is so much interested.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;Another letter from Caroline.&nbsp; I have
learnt from this epistle, that M. Charles de la Feste is &lsquo;only
one of the many friends of the Marlets&rsquo;; that though a Frenchman
by birth, and now again temporarily at Versailles, he has lived in England
many many years; that he is a talented landscape and marine painter,
and has exhibited at the <i>Salon</i>, and I think in London.&nbsp;
His style and subjects are considered somewhat peculiar in Paris&mdash;rather
English than Continental.&nbsp; I have not as yet learnt his age, or
his condition, married or single.&nbsp; From the tone and nature of
her remarks about him he sometimes seems to be a middle-aged family
man, sometimes quite the reverse.&nbsp; From his nomadic habits I should
say the latter is the most likely.&nbsp; He has travelled and seen a
great deal, she tells me, and knows more about English literature than
she knows herself.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 21.&mdash;Letter from Caroline.&nbsp; Query: Is &lsquo;a
friend of ours and the Marlets,&rsquo; of whom she now anonymously and
mysteriously speaks, the same personage as the &lsquo;M. de la Feste&rsquo;
of her former letters?&nbsp; He must be the same, I think, from his
pursuits.&nbsp; If so, whence this sudden change of tone? . . . I have
been lost in thought for at least a quarter of an hour since writing
the preceding sentence.&nbsp; Suppose my dear sister is falling in love
with this young man&mdash;there is no longer any doubt about his age;
what a very awkward, risky thing for her!&nbsp; I do hope that my mother
has an eye on these proceedings.&nbsp; But, then, poor mother never
sees the drift of anything: she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline
than I am.&nbsp; If I were there, how jealously I would watch him, and
ascertain his designs!</p>
<p>I am of a stronger nature than Caroline.&nbsp; How I have supported
her in the past through her little troubles and great griefs!&nbsp;
Is she agitated at the presence of this, to her, new and strange feeling?&nbsp;
But I am assuming her to be desperately in love, when I have no proof
of anything of the kind.&nbsp; He may be merely a casual friend, of
whom I shall hear no more.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 24.&mdash;Then he <i>is</i> a bachelor, as I suspected.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If M. de la Feste ever marries he will,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; So
she writes.&nbsp; They are getting into close quarters, obviously.&nbsp;
Also, &lsquo;Something to keep my hair smooth, which M. de la Feste
told me he had found useful for the tips of his moustache.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Very naively related this; and with how much unconsciousness of the
intimacy between them that the remark reveals!&nbsp; But my mother&mdash;what
can she be doing?&nbsp; Does she know of this?&nbsp; And if so, why
does she not allude to it in her letters to my father? . . . I have
been to look at Caroline&rsquo;s pony, in obedience to her reiterated
request that I would not miss a day in seeing that she was well cared
for.&nbsp; Anxious as Caroline was about this pony of hers before starting,
she now never mentioned the poor animal once in her letters.&nbsp; The
image of her pet suffers from displacement.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 3.&mdash;Caroline&rsquo;s forgetfulness of her pony
has naturally enough extended to me, her sister.&nbsp; It is ten days
since she last wrote, and but for a note from my mother I should not
know if she were dead or alive.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;NEWS INTERESTING AND SERIOUS</h3>
<p><i>August</i> 5.&mdash;A cloud of letters.&nbsp; A letter from Caroline,
another from mother; also one from each to my father.</p>
<p>The probability to which all the intelligence from my sister has
pointed of late turns out to be a fact.&nbsp; There is an engagement,
or almost an engagement, announced between my dear Caroline and M. de
la Feste&mdash;to Caroline&rsquo;s sublime happiness, and my mother&rsquo;s
entire satisfaction; as well as to that of the Marlets.&nbsp; They and
my mother seem to know all about the young man&mdash;which is more than
I do, though a little extended information about him, considering that
I am Caroline&rsquo;s elder sister, would not have been amiss.&nbsp;
I half feel with my father, who is much surprised, and, I am sure, not
altogether satisfied, that he should not have been consulted at all
before matters reached such a definite stage, though he is too amiable
to say so openly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t quite say that a good thing should
have been hindered for the sake of our opinion, if it is a good thing;
but the announcement comes very suddenly.&nbsp; It must have been foreseen
by my mother for some time that this upshot was probable, and Caroline
might have told me more distinctly that M. de la Feste was her lover,
instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the Marlets,
and lately dropping his name altogether.&nbsp; My father, without exactly
objecting to him as a Frenchman, &lsquo;wishes he were of English or
some other reasonable nationality for one&rsquo;s son-in-law,&rsquo;
but I tell him that the demarcations of races, kingdoms, and creeds,
are wearing down every day, that patriotism is a sort of vice, and that
the character of the individual is all we need think about in this case.&nbsp;
I wonder if, in the event of their marriage, he will continue to live
at Versailles, or if he will come to England.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 7.&mdash;A supplemental letter from Caroline, answering,
by anticipation, some of the aforesaid queries.&nbsp; She tells me that
&lsquo;Charles,&rsquo; though he makes Versailles his present home,
is by no means bound by his profession to continue there; that he will
live just where she wishes, provided it be not too far from some centre
of thought, art, and civilization.&nbsp; My mother and herself both
think that the marriage should not take place till next year.&nbsp;
He exhibits landscapes and canal scenery every year, she says; so I
suppose he is popular, and that his income is sufficient to keep them
in comfort.&nbsp; If not, I do not see why my father could not settle
something more on them than he had intended, and diminish by a little
what he had proposed for me, whilst it was imagined that I should be
the first to stand in need of such.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of engaging manner, attractive appearance, and virtuous character,&rsquo;
is the reply I receive from her in answer to my request for a personal
description.&nbsp; That is vague enough, and I would rather have had
one definite fact of complexion, voice, deed, or opinion.&nbsp; But
of course she has no eye now for material qualities; she cannot see
him as he is.&nbsp; She sees him irradiated with glories such as never
appertained and never will appertain to any man, foreign, English, or
Colonial.&nbsp; To think that Caroline, two years my junior, and so
childlike as to be five years my junior in nature, should be engaged
to be married before me.&nbsp; But that is what happens in families
more often than we are apt to remember.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 16.&mdash;Interesting news to-day.&nbsp; Charles, she
says, has pleaded that their marriage may just as well be this year
as next; and he seems to have nearly converted my mother to the same
way of thinking.&nbsp; I do not myself see any reason for delay, beyond
the standing one of my father having as yet had no opportunity of forming
an opinion upon the man, the time, or anything.&nbsp; However, he takes
his lot very quietly, and they are coming home to talk the question
over with us; Caroline having decided not to make any positive arrangements
for this change of state till she has seen me.&nbsp; Subject to my own
and my father&rsquo;s approval, she says, they are inclined to settle
the date of the wedding for November, three months from the present
time, that it shall take place here in the village, that I, of course,
shall be bridesmaid, and many other particulars.&nbsp; She draws an
artless picture of the probable effect upon the minds of the villagers
of this romantic performance in the chancel of our old church, in which
she is to be chief actor&mdash;the foreign gentleman dropping down like
a god from the skies, picking her up, and triumphantly carrying her
off.&nbsp; Her only grief will be separation from me, but this is to
be assuaged by my going and staying with her for long months at a time.&nbsp;
This simple prattle is very sweet to me, my dear sister, but I cannot
help feeling sad at the occasion of it.&nbsp; In the nature of things
it is obvious that I shall never be to you again what I hitherto have
been: your guide, counsellor, and most familiar friend.</p>
<p>M. de la Feste does certainly seem to be all that one could desire
as protector to a sensitive fragile child like Caroline, and for that
I am thankful.&nbsp; Still, I must remember that I see him as yet only
through her eyes.&nbsp; For her sake I am intensely anxious to meet
him, and scrutinise him through and through, and learn what the man
is really made of who is to have such a treasure in his keeping.&nbsp;
The engagement has certainly been formed a little precipitately; I quite
agree with my father in that: still, good and happy marriages have been
made in a hurry before now, and mother seems well satisfied.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 20.&mdash;A terrible announcement came this morning;
and we are in deep trouble.&nbsp; I have been quite unable to steady
my thoughts on anything to-day till now&mdash;half-past eleven at night&mdash;and
I only attempt writing these notes because I am too restless to remain
idle, and there is nothing but waiting and waiting left for me to do.&nbsp;
Mother has been taken dangerously ill at Versailles: they were within
a day or two of starting; but all thought of leaving must now be postponed,
for she cannot possibly be moved in her present state.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like the sound of haemorrhage at all in a woman of her full habit, and
Caroline and the Marlets have not exaggerated their accounts I am certain.&nbsp;
On the receipt of the letter my father instantly decided to go to her,
and I have been occupied all day in getting him off, for as he calculates
on being absent several days, there have been many matters for him to
arrange before setting out&mdash;the chief being to find some one who
will do duty for him next Sunday&mdash;a quest of no small difficulty
at such short notice; but at last poor old feeble Mr. Dugdale has agreed
to attempt it, with Mr. Highman, the Scripture reader, to assist him
in the lessons.</p>
<p>I fain would have gone with my father to escape the irksome anxiety
of awaiting her; but somebody had to stay, and I could best be spared.&nbsp;
George has driven him to the station to meet the last train by which
he will catch the midnight boat, and reach Havre some time in the morning.&nbsp;
He hates the sea, and a night passage in particular.&nbsp; I hope he
will get there without mishap of any kind; but I feel anxious for him,
stay-at-home as he is, and unable to cope with any difficulty.&nbsp;
Such an errand, too; the journey will be sad enough at best.&nbsp; I
almost think I ought to have been the one to go to her.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 21.&mdash;I nearly fell asleep of heaviness of spirit
last night over my writing.&nbsp; My father must have reached Paris
by this time; and now here comes a letter . . .</p>
<p><i>Later.&mdash;</i>The letter was to express an earnest hope that
my father had set out.&nbsp; My poor mother is sinking, they fear.&nbsp;
What will become of Caroline?&nbsp; O, how I wish I could see mother;
why could not both have gone?</p>
<p><i>Later</i>.&mdash;I get up from my chair, and walk from window
to window, and then come and write a line.&nbsp; I cannot even divine
how poor Caroline&rsquo;s marriage is to be carried out if mother dies.&nbsp;
I pray that father may have got there in time to talk to her and receive
some directions from her about Caroline and M. de la Feste&mdash;a man
whom neither my father nor I have seen.&nbsp; I, who might be useful
in this emergency, am doomed to stay here, waiting in suspense.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 23.&mdash;A letter from my father containing the sad
news that my mother&rsquo;s spirit has flown.&nbsp; Poor little Caroline
is heart-broken&mdash;she was always more my mother&rsquo;s pet than
I was.&nbsp; It is some comfort to know that my father arrived in time
to hear from her own lips her strongly expressed wish that Caroline&rsquo;s
marriage should be solemnized as soon as possible.&nbsp; M. de la Feste
seems to have been a great favourite of my dear mother&rsquo;s; and
I suppose it now becomes almost a sacred duty of my father to accept
him as a son-in-law without criticism.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;HER GLOOM LIGHTENS A LITTLE</h3>
<p><i>September</i> 10.&mdash;I have inserted nothing in my diary for
more than a fortnight.&nbsp; Events have been altogether too sad for
me to have the spirit to put them on paper.&nbsp; And yet there comes
a time when the act of recording one&rsquo;s trouble is recognized as
a welcome method of dwelling upon it . . .</p>
<p>My dear mother has been brought home and buried here in the parish.&nbsp;
It was not so much her own wish that this should be done as my father&rsquo;s,
who particularly desired that she should lie in the family vault beside
his first wife.&nbsp; I saw them side by side before the vault was closed&mdash;two
women beloved by one man.&nbsp; As I stood, and Caroline by my side,
I fell into a sort of dream, and had an odd fancy that Caroline and
I might be also beloved of one, and lie like these together&mdash;an
impossibility, of course, being sisters.&nbsp; When I awoke from my
reverie Caroline took my hand and said it was time to leave.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 14.&mdash;The wedding is indefinitely postponed.&nbsp;
Caroline is like a girl awakening in the middle of a somnambulistic
experience, and does not realize where she is, or how she stands.&nbsp;
She walks about silently, and I cannot tell her thoughts, as I used
to do.&nbsp; It was her own doing to write to M. de la Feste and tell
him that the wedding could not possibly take place this autumn as originally
planned.&nbsp; There is something depressing in this long postponement
if she is to marry him at all; and yet I do not see how it could be
avoided.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 20.&mdash;I have had so much to occupy me in consoling
Caroline that I have been continually overlooking my diary.&nbsp; Her
life was much nearer to my mother&rsquo;s than mine was.&nbsp; She has
never, as I, lived away from home long enough to become self-dependent,
and hence in her first loss, and all that it involved, she drooped like
a rain-beaten lily.&nbsp; But she is of a nature whose wounds soon heal,
even though they may be deep, and the supreme poignancy of her sorrow
has already passed.</p>
<p>My father is of opinion that the wedding should not be delayed too
long.&nbsp; While at Versailles he made the acquaintance of M. de la
Feste, and though they had but a short and hurried communion with each
other, he was much impressed by M. de la Feste&rsquo;s disposition and
conduct, and is strongly in favour of his suit.&nbsp; It is odd that
Caroline&rsquo;s betrothed should influence in his favour all who come
near him.&nbsp; His portrait, which dear Caroline has shown me, exhibits
him to be of a physique that partly accounts for this: but there must
be something more than mere appearance, and it is probably some sort
of glamour or fascinating power&mdash;the quality which prevented Caroline
from describing him to me with any accuracy of detail.&nbsp; At the
same time, I see from the photograph that his face and head are remarkably
well formed; and though the contours of his mouth are hidden by his
moustache, his arched brows show well the romantic disposition of a
true lover and painter of Nature.&nbsp; I think that the owner of such
a face as this must be tender and sympathetic and true.</p>
<p>October 30.&mdash;As my sister&rsquo;s grief for her mother becomes
more and more calmed, her love for M. de la Feste begins to reassume
its former absorbing command of her.&nbsp; She thinks of him incessantly,
and writes whole treatises to him by way of letters.&nbsp; Her blank
disappointment at his announcement of his inability to pay us a visit
quite so soon as he had promised, was quite tragic.&nbsp; I, too, am
disappointed, for I wanted to see and estimate him.&nbsp; But having
arranged to go to Holland to seize some aerial effects for his pictures,
which are only to be obtained at this time of the autumn, he is obliged
to postpone his journey this way, which is now to be made early in the
new year.&nbsp; I think myself that he ought to have come at all sacrifices,
considering Caroline&rsquo;s recent loss, the sad postponement of what
she was looking forward to, and her single-minded affection for him.&nbsp;
Still, who knows; his professional success is important.&nbsp; Moreover,
she is cheerful, and hopeful, and the delay will soon be overpast.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;SHE BEHOLDS THE ATTRACTIVE STRANGER</h3>
<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;We have had such a dull life here all the
winter that I have found nothing important enough to set down, and broke
off my journal accordingly.&nbsp; I resume it now to make an entry on
the subject of dear Caroline&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; It seems that she
was too grieved, immediately after the loss of our mother, to answer
definitely the question of M. de la Feste how long the postponement
was to be; then, afterwards, it was agreed that the matter should be
discussed on his autumn visit; but as he did not come, it has remained
in abeyance till this week, when Caroline, with the greatest simplicity
and confidence, has written to him without any further pressure on his
part, and told him that she is quite ready to fix the time, and will
do so as soon as he arrives to see her.&nbsp; She is a little frightened
now, lest it should seem forward in her to have revived the subject
of her own accord; but she may assume that his question has been waiting
on for an answer ever since, and that she has, therefore, acted only
within her promise.&nbsp; In truth, the secret at the bottom of it all
is that she is somewhat saddened because he has not latterly reminded
her of the pause in their affairs&mdash;that, in short, his original
impatience to possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously.&nbsp;
I suppose that he loves her as much as ever; indeed, I am sure he must
do so, seeing how lovable she is.&nbsp; It is mostly thus with all men
when women are out of their sight; they grow negligent.&nbsp; Caroline
must have patience, and remember that a man of his genius has many and
important calls upon his time.&nbsp; In justice to her I must add that
she does remember it fairly well, and has as much patience as any girl
ever had in the circumstances.&nbsp; He hopes to come at the beginning
of April at latest.&nbsp; Well, when he comes we shall see him.</p>
<p><i>April 5.&mdash;</i>I think that what M. de la Feste writes is
reasonable enough, though Caroline looks heart-sick about it.&nbsp;
It is hardly worth while for him to cross all the way to England and
back just now, while the sea is so turbulent, seeing that he will be
obliged, in any event, to come in May, when he has to be in London for
professional purposes, at which time he can take us easily on his way
both coming and going.&nbsp; When Caroline becomes his wife she will
be more practical, no doubt; but she is such a child as yet that there
is no contenting her with reasons.&nbsp; However, the time will pass
quickly, there being so much to do in preparing a trousseau for her,
which must now be put in hand in order that we may have plenty of leisure
to get it ready.&nbsp; On no account must Caroline be married in half-mourning;
I am sure that mother, could she know, would not wish it, and it is
odd that Caroline should be so intractably persistent on this point,
when she is usually so yielding.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 30.&mdash;This month has flown on swallow&rsquo;s wings.&nbsp;
We are in a great state of excitement&mdash;I as much as she&mdash;I
cannot quite tell why.&nbsp; He is really coming in ten days, he says.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 9.&nbsp; <i>Four p.m</i>.&mdash;I am so agitated I can
scarcely write, and yet am particularly impelled to do so before leaving
my room.&nbsp; It is the unexpected shape of an expected event which
has caused my absurd excitement, which proves me almost as much a school-girl
as Caroline.</p>
<p>M. de la Feste was not, as we understood, to have come till to-morrow;
but he is here&mdash;just arrived.&nbsp; All household directions have
devolved upon me, for my father, not thinking M. de la Feste would appear
before us for another four-and-twenty hours, left home before post time
to attend a distant consecration; and hence Caroline and I were in no
small excitement when Charles&rsquo;s letter was opened, and we read
that he had been unexpectedly favoured in the dispatch of his studio
work, and would follow his letter in a few hours.&nbsp; We sent the
covered carriage to meet the train indicated, and waited like two newly
strung harps for the first sound of the returning wheels.&nbsp; At last
we heard them on the gravel; and the question arose who was to receive
him.&nbsp; It was, strictly speaking, my duty; but I felt timid; I could
not help shirking it, and insisted that Caroline should go down.&nbsp;
She did not, however, go near the door as she usually does when anybody
is expected, but waited palpitating in the drawing-room.&nbsp; He little
thought when he saw the silent hall, and the apparently deserted house,
how that house was at the very same moment alive and throbbing with
interest under the surface.&nbsp; I stood at the back of the upper landing,
where nobody could see me from downstairs, and heard him walk across
the hall&mdash;a lighter step than my father&rsquo;s&mdash;and heard
him then go into the drawing-room, and the servant shut the door behind
him and go away.</p>
<p>What a pretty lover&rsquo;s meeting they must have had in there all
to themselves!&nbsp; Caroline&rsquo;s sweet face looking up from her
black gown&mdash;how it must have touched him.&nbsp; I know she wept
very much, for I heard her; and her eyes will be red afterwards, and
no wonder, poor dear, though she is no doubt happy.&nbsp; I can imagine
what she is telling him while I write this&mdash;her fears lest anything
should have happened to prevent his coming after all&mdash;gentle, smiling
reproaches for his long delay; and things of that sort.&nbsp; His two
portmanteaus are at this moment crossing the landing on the way to his
room.&nbsp; I wonder if I ought to go down.</p>
<p><i>A little later</i>.&mdash;I have seen him!&nbsp; It was not at
all in the way that I intended to encounter him, and I am vexed.&nbsp;
Just after his portmanteaus were brought up I went out from my room
to descend, when, at the moment of stepping towards the first stair,
my eyes were caught by an object in the hall below, and I paused for
an instant, till I saw that it was a bundle of canvas and sticks, composing
a sketching tent and easel.&nbsp; At the same nick of time the drawing-room
door opened and the affianced pair came out.&nbsp; They were saying
they would go into the garden; and he waited a moment while she put
on her hat.&nbsp; My idea was to let them pass on without seeing me,
since they seemed not to want my company, but I had got too far on the
landing to retreat; he looked up, and stood staring at me&mdash;engrossed
to a dream-like fixity.&nbsp; Thereupon I, too, instead of advancing
as I ought to have done, stood moonstruck and awkward, and before I
could gather my weak senses sufficiently to descend, she had called
him, and they went out by the garden door together.&nbsp; I then thought
of following them, but have changed my mind, and come here to jot down
these few lines.&nbsp; It is all I am fit for . . .</p>
<p>He is even more handsome than I expected.&nbsp; I was right in feeling
he must have an attraction beyond that of form: it appeared even in
that momentary glance.&nbsp; How happy Caroline ought to be.&nbsp; But
I must, of course, go down to be ready with tea in the drawing-room
by the time they come indoors.</p>
<p>11 p.m.&mdash;I have made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste; and
I seem to be another woman from the effect of it.&nbsp; I cannot describe
why this should be so, but conversation with him seems to expand the
view, and open the heart, and raise one as upon stilts to wider prospects.&nbsp;
He has a good intellectual forehead, perfect eyebrows, dark hair and
eyes, an animated manner, and a persuasive voice.&nbsp; His voice is
soft in quality&mdash;too soft for a man, perhaps; and yet on second
thoughts I would not have it less so.&nbsp; We have been talking of
his art: I had no notion that art demanded such sacrifices or such tender
devotion; or that there were two roads for choice within its precincts,
the road of vulgar money-making, and the road of high aims and consequent
inappreciation for many long years by the public.&nbsp; That he has
adopted the latter need not be said to those who understand him.&nbsp;
It is a blessing for Caroline that she has been chosen by such a man,
and she ought not to lament at postponements and delays, since they
have arisen unavoidably.&nbsp; Whether he finds hers a sufficiently
rich nature, intellectually and emotionally, for his own, I know not,
but he seems occasionally to be disappointed at her simple views of
things.&nbsp; Does he really feel such love for her at this moment as
he no doubt believes himself to be feeling, and as he no doubt hopes
to feel for the remainder of his life towards her?</p>
<p>It was a curious thing he told me when we were left for a few minutes
alone; that Caroline had alluded so slightly to me in her conversation
and letters that he had not realized my presence in the house here at
all.&nbsp; But, of course, it was only natural that she should write
and talk most about herself.&nbsp; I suppose it was on account of the
fact of his being taken in some measure unawares, that I caught him
on two or three occasions regarding me fixedly in a way that disquieted
me somewhat, having been lately in so little society; till my glance
aroused him from his reverie, and he looked elsewhere in some confusion.&nbsp;
It was fortunate that he did so, and thus failed to notice my own.&nbsp;
It shows that he, too, is not particularly a society person.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 10.&mdash;Have had another interesting conversation with
M. de la Feste on schools of landscape painting in the drawing-room
after dinner this evening&mdash;my father having fallen asleep, and
left nobody but Caroline and myself for Charles to talk to.&nbsp; I
did not mean to say so much to him, and had taken a volume of <i>Modern
Painters</i> from the bookcase to occupy myself with, while leaving
the two lovers to themselves; but he would include me in his audience,
and I was obliged to lay the book aside.&nbsp; However, I insisted on
keeping Caroline in the conversation, though her views on pictorial
art were only too charmingly crude and primitive.</p>
<p>To-morrow, if fine, we are all three going to Wherryborne Wood, where
Charles will give us practical illustrations of the principles of coloring
that he has enumerated to-night.&nbsp; I am determined not to occupy
his attention to the exclusion of Caroline, and my plan is that when
we are in the dense part of the wood I will lag behind, and slip away,
and leave them to return by themselves.&nbsp; I suppose the reason of
his attentiveness to me lies in his simply wishing to win the good opinion
of one who is so closely united to Caroline, and so likely to influence
her good opinion of him.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 11.&nbsp; <i>Late.&mdash;</i>I cannot sleep, and in desperation
have lit my candle and taken up my pen.&nbsp; My restlessness is occasioned
by what has occurred to-day, which at first I did not mean to write
down, or trust to any heart but my own.&nbsp; We went to Wherryborne
Wood&mdash;Caroline, Charles and I, as we had intended&mdash;and walked
all three along the green track through the midst, Charles in the middle
between Caroline and myself.&nbsp; Presently I found that, as usual,
he and I were the only talkers, Caroline amusing herself by observing
birds and squirrels as she walked docilely alongside her betrothed.&nbsp;
Having noticed this I dropped behind at the first opportunity and slipped
among the trees, in a direction in which I knew I should find another
path that would take me home.&nbsp; Upon this track I by and by emerged,
and walked along it in silent thought till, at a bend, I suddenly encountered
M. de la Feste standing stock still and smiling thoughtfully at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Caroline?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a little way off,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;When we
missed you from behind us we thought you might have mistaken the direction
we had followed, so she has gone one way to find you and I have come
this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We then went back to find Caroline, but could not discover her anywhere,
and the upshot was that he and I were wandering about the woods alone
for more than an hour.&nbsp; On reaching home we found she had given
us up after searching a little while, and arrived there some time before.&nbsp;
I should not be so disturbed by the incident if I had not perceived
that, during her absence from us, he did not make any earnest effort
to rediscover her; and in answer to my repeated expressions of wonder
as to whither she could have wandered he only said, &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s
quite safe; she told me she knew the way home from any part of this
wood.&nbsp; Let us go on with our talk.&nbsp; I assure you I value this
privilege of being with one I so much admire more than you imagine;&rsquo;
and other things of that kind.&nbsp; I was so foolish as to show a little
perturbation&mdash;I cannot tell why I did not control myself; and I
think he noticed that I was not cool.&nbsp; Caroline has, with her simple
good faith, thought nothing of the occurrence; yet altogether I am not
satisfied.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;HER SITUATION IS A TRYING ONE</h3>
<p><i>May 15</i>.&mdash;The more I think of it day after day, the more
convinced I am that my suspicions are true.&nbsp; He is too interested
in me&mdash;well, in plain words, loves me; or, not to degrade that
phrase, has a wild passion for me; and his affection for Caroline is
that towards a sister only.&nbsp; That is the distressing truth; how
it has come about I cannot tell, and it wears upon me.</p>
<p>A hundred little circumstances have revealed this to me, and the
longer I dwell upon it the more agitating does the consideration become.&nbsp;
Heaven only can help me out of the terrible difficulty in which this
places me.&nbsp; I have done nothing to encourage him to be faithless
to her.&nbsp; I have studiously kept out of his way; have persistently
refused to be a third in their interviews.&nbsp; Yet all to no purpose.&nbsp;
Some fatality has seemed to rule, ever since he came to the house, that
this disastrous inversion of things should arise.&nbsp; If I had only
foreseen the possibility of it before he arrived, how gladly would I
have departed on some visit or other to the meanest friend to hinder
such an apparent treachery.&nbsp; But I blindly welcomed him&mdash;indeed,
made myself particularly agreeable to him for her sake.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of my suspicions being wrong; not until they
have reached absolute certainty have I dared even to admit the truth
to myself.&nbsp; His conduct to-day would have proved them true had
I entertained no previous apprehensions.&nbsp; Some photographs of myself
came for me by post, and they were handed round at the breakfast table
and criticised.&nbsp; I put them temporarily on a side table, and did
not remember them until an hour afterwards when I was in my own room.&nbsp;
On going to fetch them I discovered him standing at the table with his
back towards the door bending over the photographs, one of which he
raised to his lips.</p>
<p>The witnessing this act so frightened me that I crept away to escape
observation.&nbsp; It was the climax to a series of slight and significant
actions all tending to the same conclusion.&nbsp; The question for me
now is, what am I to do?&nbsp; To go away is what first occurs to me,
but what reason can I give Caroline and my father for such a step; besides,
it might precipitate some sort of catastrophe by driving Charles to
desperation.&nbsp; For the present, therefore, I have decided that I
can only wait, though his contiguity is strangely disturbing to me now,
and I hardly retain strength of mind to encounter him.&nbsp; How will
the distressing complication end?</p>
<p><i>May</i> 19.&mdash;And so it has come!&nbsp; My mere avoidance
of him has precipitated the worst issue&mdash;a declaration.&nbsp; I
had occasion to go into the kitchen garden to gather some of the double
ragged-robins which grew in a corner there.&nbsp; Almost as soon as
I had entered I heard footsteps without.&nbsp; The door opened and shut,
and I turned to behold him just inside it.&nbsp; As the garden is closed
by four walls and the gardener was absent, the spot ensured absolute
privacy.&nbsp; He came along the path by the asparagus-bed, and overtook
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know why I come, Alicia?&rsquo; said he, in a tremulous
voice.</p>
<p>I said nothing, and hung my head, for by his tone I did know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;it is you I love; my sentiment
towards your sister is one of affection too, but protective, tutelary
affection&mdash;no more.&nbsp; Say what you will I cannot help it.&nbsp;
I mistook my feeling for her, and I know how much I am to blame for
my want of self-knowledge.&nbsp; I have fought against this discovery
night and day; but it cannot be concealed.&nbsp; Why did I ever see
you, since I could not see you till I had committed myself?&nbsp; At
the moment my eyes beheld you on that day of my arrival, I said, &ldquo;This
is the woman for whom my manhood has waited.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ever since
an unaccountable fascination has riveted my heart to you.&nbsp; Answer
one word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, M. de la Feste!&rsquo; I burst out.&nbsp; What I said more
I cannot remember, but I suppose that the misery I was in showed pretty
plainly, for he said, &lsquo;Something must be done to let her know;
perhaps I have mistaken her affection, too; but all depends upon what
you feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell what I feel,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;except that
this seems terrible treachery; and every moment that I stay with you
here makes it worse! .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; Try to keep faith with
her&mdash;her young heart is tender; believe me there is no mistake
in the quality of her love for you.&nbsp; Would there were!&nbsp; This
would kill her if she knew it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sighed heavily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She ought never to be my wife,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leaving my own happiness out of the question,
it would be a cruelty to her to unite her to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said I could not hear such words from him, and begged him in tears
to go away; he obeyed, and I heard the garden door shut behind him.&nbsp;
What is to be the end of the announcement, and the fate of Caroline?</p>
<p><i>May</i> 20.&mdash;I put a good deal on paper yesterday, and yet
not all.&nbsp; I was, in truth, hoping against hope, against conviction,
against too conscious self-judgment.&nbsp; I scarcely dare own the truth
now, yet it relieves my aching heart to set it down.&nbsp; Yes, I love
him&mdash;that is the dreadful fact, and I can no longer parry, evade,
or deny it to myself though to the rest of the world it can never be
owned.&nbsp; I love Caroline&rsquo;s betrothed, and he loves me.&nbsp;
It is no yesterday&rsquo;s passion, cultivated by our converse; it came
at first sight, independently of my will; and my talk with him yesterday
made rather against it than for it, but, alas, did not quench it.&nbsp;
God forgive us both for this terrible treachery.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;All is vague; our courses shapeless.&nbsp; He
comes and goes, being occupied, ostensibly at least, with sketching
in his tent in the wood.&nbsp; Whether he and she see each other privately
I cannot tell, but I rather think they do not; that she sadly awaits
him, and he does not appear.&nbsp; Not a sign from him that my repulse
has done him any good, or that he will endeavour to keep faith with
her.&nbsp; O, if I only had the compulsion of a god, and the self-sacrifice
of a martyr!</p>
<p><i>May</i> 31.&mdash;It has all ended&mdash;or rather this act of
the sad drama has ended&mdash;in nothing.&nbsp; He has left us.&nbsp;
No day for the fulfilment of the engagement with Caroline is named,
my father not being the man to press any one on such a matter, or, indeed,
to interfere in any way.&nbsp; We two girls are, in fact, quite defenceless
in a case of this kind; lovers may come when they choose, and desert
when they choose; poor father is too urbane to utter a word of remonstrance
or inquiry.&nbsp; Moreover, as the approved of my dead mother, M. de
la Feste has a sort of autocratic power with my father, who holds it
unkind to her memory to have an opinion about him.&nbsp; I, feeling
it my duty, asked M. de la Feste at the last moment about the engagement,
in a voice I could not keep firm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since the death of your mother all has been indefinite&mdash;all!&rsquo;
he said gloomily.&nbsp; That was the whole.&nbsp; Possibly, Wherryborne
Rectory may see him no more.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 7 .&mdash;M. de la Feste has written&mdash;one letter
to her, one to me.&nbsp; Hers could not have been very warm, for she
did not brighten on reading it.&nbsp; Mine was an ordinary note of friendship,
filling an ordinary sheet of paper, which I handed over to Caroline
when I had finished looking it through.&nbsp; But there was a scrap
of paper in the bottom of the envelope, which I dared not show any one.&nbsp;
This scrap is his real letter: I scanned it alone in my room, trembling,
hot and cold by turns.&nbsp; He tells me he is very wretched; that he
deplores what has happened, but was helpless.&nbsp; Why did I let him
see me, if only to make him faithless.&nbsp; Alas, alas!</p>
<p><i>June</i> 21 .&mdash;My dear Caroline has lost appetite, spirits,
health.&nbsp; Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&nbsp; His letters
to her grow colder&mdash;if indeed he has written more than one.&nbsp;
He has refrained from writing again to me&mdash;he knows it is no use.&nbsp;
Altogether the situation that he and she and I are in is melancholy
in the extreme.&nbsp; Why are human hearts so perverse?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;HER INGENUITY INSTIGATES HER</h3>
<p><i>September</i> 19.&mdash;Three months of anxious care&mdash;till
at length I have taken the extreme step of writing to him.&nbsp; Our
chief distress has been caused by the state of poor Caroline, who, after
sinking by degrees into such extreme weakness as to make it doubtful
if she can ever recover full vigour, has to-day been taken much worse.&nbsp;
Her position is very critical.&nbsp; The doctor says plainly that she
is dying of a broken heart&mdash;and that even the removal of the cause
may not now restore her.&nbsp; Ought I to have written to Charles sooner?&nbsp;
But how could I when she forbade me?&nbsp; It was her pride only which
instigated her, and I should not have obeyed.</p>
<p><i>Sept</i>. 26.&mdash;Charles has arrived and has seen her.&nbsp;
He is shocked, conscience-stricken, remorseful.&nbsp; I have told him
that he can do no good beyond cheering her by his presence.&nbsp; I
do not know what he thinks of proposing to her if she gets better, but
he says little to her at present: indeed he dares not: his words agitate
her dangerously.</p>
<p><i>Sept</i>. 28.&mdash;After a struggle between duty and selfishness,
such as I pray to Heaven I may never have to undergo again, I have asked
him for pity&rsquo;s sake to make her his wife, here and now, as she
lies.&nbsp; I said to him that the poor child would not trouble him
long; and such a solemnization would soothe her last hours as nothing
else could do.&nbsp; He said that he would willingly do so, and had
thought of it himself; but for one forbidding reason: in the event of
her death as his wife he can never marry me, her sister, according to
our laws.&nbsp; I started at his words.&nbsp; He went on: &lsquo;On
the other hand, if I were sure that immediate marriage with me would
save her life, I would not refuse, for possibly I might after a while,
and out of sight of you, make myself fairly content with one of so sweet
a disposition as hers; but if, as is probable, neither my marrying her
nor any other act can avail to save her life, by so doing I lose both
her and you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not answer him.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 29.&mdash;</i>He continued firm in his reasons for refusal
till this morning, and then I became possessed with an idea, which I
at once propounded to him.&nbsp; It was that he should at least consent
to a <i>form</i> of marriage with Caroline, in consideration of her
love; a form which need not be a legal union, but one which would satisfy
her sick and enfeebled soul.&nbsp; Such things have been done, and the
sentiment of feeling herself his would inexpressibly comfort her mind,
I am sure.&nbsp; Then, if she is taken from us, I should not have lost
the power of becoming his lawful wife at some future day, if it indeed
should be deemed expedient; if, on the other hand, she lives, he can
on her recovery inform her of the incompleteness of their marriage contract,
the ceremony can be repeated, and I can, and I am sure willingly would,
avoid troubling them with my presence till grey hairs and wrinkles make
his unfortunate passion for me a thing of the past.&nbsp; I put all
this before him; but he demurred.</p>
<p><i>Sept</i>. 30.&mdash;I have urged him again.&nbsp; He says he will
consider.&nbsp; It is no time to mince matters, and as a further inducement
I have offered to enter into a solemn engagement to marry him myself
a year after her death.</p>
<p><i>Sept</i>. 30.&nbsp; <i>Later</i>.&mdash;An agitating interview.&nbsp;
He says he will agree to whatever I propose, the three possibilities
and our contingent acts being recorded as follows: First, in the event
of dear Caroline being taken from us, I marry him on the expiration
of a year: Second, in the forlorn chance of her recovery I take upon
myself the responsibility of explaining to Caroline the true nature
of the ceremony he has gone through with her, that it was done at my
suggestion to make her happy at once, before a special licence could
be obtained, and that a public ceremony at church is awaiting her: Third,
in the unlikely event of her cooling, and refusing to repeat the ceremony
with him, I leave England, join him abroad, and there wed him, agreeing
not to live in England again till Caroline has either married another
or regards her attachment to Charles as a bygone matter.&nbsp; I have
thought over these conditions, and have agreed to them all as they stand.</p>
<p>11 <i>p.m</i>.&mdash;I do not much like this scheme, after all.&nbsp;
For one thing, I have just sounded my father on it before parting with
him for the night, my impression having been that he would see no objection.&nbsp;
But he says he could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding;
however good our intentions, and even though the poor girl were dying,
it would not be right.&nbsp; So I sadly seek my pillow.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 1.&mdash;I am sure my father is wrong in his view.&nbsp;
Why is it not right, if it would be balm to Caroline&rsquo;s wounded
soul, and if a real ceremony is absolutely refused by Charles&mdash;moreover
is hardly practicable in the difficulty of getting a special licence,
if he were agreed?&nbsp; My father does not know, or will not believe,
that Caroline&rsquo;s attachment has been the cause of her hopeless
condition.&nbsp; But that it is so, and that the form of words would
give her inexpressible happiness, I know well; for I whispered tentatively
in her ear on such marriages, and the effect was great.&nbsp; Henceforth
my father cannot be taken into confidence on the subject of Caroline.&nbsp;
He does not understand her.</p>
<p>12 <i>o&rsquo;clock noon</i>.&mdash;I have taken advantage of my
father&rsquo;s absence to-day to confide my secret notion to a thoughtful
young man, who called here this morning to speak to my father.&nbsp;
He is the Mr. Theophilus Higham, of whom I have already had occasion
to speak&mdash;a Scripture reader in the next town, and is soon going
to be ordained.&nbsp; I told him the pitiable case, and my remedy.&nbsp;
He says ardently that he will assist me&mdash;would do anything for
me (he is, in truth, an admirer of mine); he sees no wrong in such an
act of charity.&nbsp; He is coming again to the house this afternoon
before my father returns, to carry out the idea.&nbsp; I have spoken
to Charles, who promises to be ready.&nbsp; I must now break the news
to Caroline.</p>
<p>11 o&rsquo;clock p.m.&mdash;I have been in too much excitement till
now to set down the result.&nbsp; We have accomplished our plan; and
though I feel like a guilty sinner, I am glad.&nbsp; My father, of course,
is not to be informed as yet.&nbsp; Caroline has had a seraphic expression
upon her wasted, transparent face ever since.&nbsp; I should hardly
be surprised if it really saved her life even now, and rendered a legitimate
union necessary between them.&nbsp; In that case my father can be informed
of the whole proceeding, and in the face of such wonderful success cannot
disapprove.&nbsp; Meanwhile poor Charles has not lost the possibility
of taking unworthy me to fill her place should she&mdash;.&nbsp; But
I cannot contemplate that alternative unmoved, and will not write it.&nbsp;
Charles left for the South of Europe immediately after the ceremony.&nbsp;
He was in a high-strung, throbbing, almost wild state of mind at first,
but grew calmer under my exhortations.&nbsp; I had to pay the penalty
of receiving a farewell kiss from him, which I much regret, considering
its meaning; but he took me so unexpectedly, and in a moment was gone.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 6.&mdash;She certainly is better, and even when she found
that Charles had been suddenly obliged to leave, she received the news
quite cheerfully.&nbsp; The doctor says that her apparent improvement
may be delusive; but I think our impressing upon her the necessity of
keeping what has occurred a secret from papa, and everybody, helps to
give her a zest for life.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 8.&mdash;She is still mending.&nbsp; I am glad to have
saved her&mdash;my only sister&mdash;if I have done so; though I shall
now never become Charles&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;A SURPRISE AWAITS HER</h3>
<p><i>Feb</i>. 5.&mdash;Writing has been absolutely impossible for a
long while; but I now reach a stage at which it seems possible to jot
down a line.&nbsp; Caroline&rsquo;s recovery, extending over four months,
has been very engrossing; at first slow, latterly rapid.&nbsp; But a
fearful complication of affairs attends it!</p>
<blockquote><p>O what a tangled web we weave<br />
When first we practise to deceive!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles has written reproachfully to me from Venice, where he is.&nbsp;
He says how can he fulfil in the real what he has enacted in the counterfeit,
while he still loves me?&nbsp; Yet how, on the other hand, can he leave
it unfulfilled?&nbsp; All this time I have not told her, and up to this
minute she believes that he has indeed taken her for better, for worse,
till death them do part.&nbsp; It is a harassing position for me, and
all three.&nbsp; In the awful approach of death, one&rsquo;s judgment
loses its balance, and we do anything to meet the exigencies of the
moment, with a single eye to the one who excites our sympathy, and from
whom we seem on the brink of being separated for ever.</p>
<p>Had he really married her at that time all would be settled now.&nbsp;
But he took too much thought; she might have died, and then he had his
reason.&nbsp; If indeed it had turned out so, I should now be perhaps
a sad woman; but not a tempest-tossed one . . . The possibility of his
claiming me after all is what lies at the root of my agitation.&nbsp;
Everything hangs by a thread.&nbsp; Suppose I tell her the marriage
was a mockery; suppose she is indignant with me and with him for the
deception&mdash;and then?&nbsp; Otherwise, suppose she is not indignant
but forgives all; he is bound to marry her; and honour constrains me
to urge him thereto, in spite of what he protests, and to smooth the
way to this issue by my method of informing her.&nbsp; I have meant
to tell her the last month&mdash;ever since she has been strong enough
to bear such tidings; but I have been without the power&mdash;the moral
force.&nbsp; Surely I must write, and get him to come and assist me.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 14.&mdash;She continually wonders why he does not come,
the five months of his enforced absence having expired; and still more
she wonders why he does not write oftener.&nbsp; His last letter was
cold, she says, and she fears he regrets his marriage, which he may
only have celebrated with her for pity&rsquo;s sake, thinking she was
sure to die.&nbsp; It makes one&rsquo;s heart bleed to hear her hovering
thus so near the truth, and yet never discerning its actual shape.</p>
<p>A minor trouble besets me, too, in the person of the young Scripture
reader, whose conscience pricks him for the part he played.&nbsp; Surely
I am punished, if ever woman were, for a too ingenious perversion of
her better judgment!</p>
<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;She is practically well.&nbsp; The faint pink
revives in her cheek, though it is not quite so full as heretofore.&nbsp;
But she still wonders what she can have done to offend &lsquo;her dear
husband,&rsquo; and I have been obliged to tell the smallest part of
the truth&mdash;an unimportant fragment of the whole, in fact, I said
that I feared for the moment he might regret the precipitancy of the
act, which her illness caused, his affairs not having been quite sufficiently
advanced for marriage just then, though he will doubtless come to her
as soon as he has a home ready.&nbsp; Meanwhile I have written to him,
peremptorily, to come and relieve me in this awful dilemma.&nbsp; He
will find no note of love in that.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 10.&mdash;To my alarm the letter I lately addressed
to him at Venice, where he is staying, as well as the last one she sent
him, have received no reply.&nbsp; She thinks he is ill.&nbsp; I do
not quite think that, but I wish we could hear from him.&nbsp; Perhaps
the peremptoriness of my words had offended him; it grieves me to think
it possible.&nbsp; <i>I</i> offend him!&nbsp; But too much of this.&nbsp;
I <i>must</i> tell her the truth, or she may in her ignorance commit
herself to some course or other that may be ruinously compromising.&nbsp;
She said plaintively just now that if he could see her, and know how
occupied with him and him alone is her every waking hour, she is sure
he would forgive her the wicked presumption of becoming his wife.&nbsp;
Very sweet all that, and touching.&nbsp; I could not conceal my tears.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;The house is in confusion; my father is angry
and distressed, and I am distracted.&nbsp; Caroline has disappeared&mdash;gone
away secretly.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking that I know where she is
gone to.&nbsp; How guilty I seem, and how innocent she!&nbsp; O that
I had told her before now!</p>
<p>1 <i>o&rsquo;clock</i>.&mdash;No trace of her as yet.&nbsp; We find
also that the little waiting-maid we have here in training has disappeared
with Caroline, and there is not much doubt that Caroline, fearing to
travel alone, has induced this girl to go with her as companion.&nbsp;
I am almost sure she has started in desperation to find him, and that
Venice is her goal.&nbsp; Why should she run away, if not to join her
husband, as she thinks him?&nbsp; Now that I consider, there have been
indications of this wish in her for days, as in birds of passage there
lurk signs of their incipient intention; and yet I did not think she
would have taken such an extreme step, unaided, and without consulting
me.&nbsp; I can only jot down the bare facts&mdash;I have no time for
reflections.&nbsp; But fancy Caroline travelling across the continent
of Europe with a chit of a girl, who will be more of a charge than an
assistance!&nbsp; They will be a mark for every marauder who encounters
them.</p>
<p><i>Evening</i>: 8 <i>o&rsquo;clock</i>.&mdash;Yes, it is as I surmised.&nbsp;
She has gone to join him.&nbsp; A note posted by her in Budmouth Regis
at daybreak has reached me this afternoon&mdash;thanks to the fortunate
chance of one of the servants calling for letters in town to-day, or
I should not have got it until to-morrow.&nbsp; She merely asserts her
determination of going to him, and has started privately, that nothing
may hinder her; stating nothing about her route.&nbsp; That such a gentle
thing should suddenly become so calmly resolute quite surprises me.&nbsp;
Alas, he may have left Venice&mdash;she may not find him for weeks&mdash;may
not at all.</p>
<p>My father, on learning the facts, bade me at once have everything
ready by nine this evening, in time to drive to the train that meets
the night steam-boat.&nbsp; This I have done, and there being an hour
to spare before we start, I relieve the suspense of waiting by taking
up my pen.&nbsp; He says overtake her we must, and calls Charles the
hardest of names.&nbsp; He believes, of course, that she is merely an
infatuated girl rushing off to meet her lover; and how can the wretched
I tell him that she is more, and in a sense better than that&mdash;yet
not sufficiently more and better to make this flight to Charles anything
but a still greater danger to her than a mere lover&rsquo;s impulse.&nbsp;
We shall go by way of Paris, and we think we may overtake her there.&nbsp;
I hear my father walking restlessly up and down the hall, and can write
no more.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;SHE TRAVELS IN PURSUIT</h3>
<p><i>April</i> 16.&nbsp; <i>Evening, Paris, H&ocirc;tel</i> ---.&mdash;There
is no overtaking her at this place; but she has been here, as I thought,
no other hotel in Paris being known to her.&nbsp; We go on to-morrow
morning.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 18.&nbsp; <i>Venice.&mdash;</i>A morning of adventures
and emotions which leave me sick and weary, and yet unable to sleep,
though I have lain down on the sofa of my room for more than an hour
in the attempt.&nbsp; I therefore make up my diary to date in a hurried
fashion, for the sake of the riddance it affords to ideas which otherwise
remain suspended hotly in the brain.</p>
<p>We arrived here this morning in broad sunlight, which lit up the
sea-girt buildings as we approached so that they seemed like a city
of cork floating raft-like on the smooth, blue deep.&nbsp; But I only
glanced from the carriage window at the lovely scene, and we were soon
across the intervening water and inside the railway station.&nbsp; When
we got to the front steps the row of black gondolas and the shouts of
the gondoliers so bewildered my father that he was understood to require
two gondolas instead of one with two oars, and so I found him in one
and myself in another.&nbsp; We got this righted after a while, and
were rowed at once to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni where M.
de la Feste had been staying when we last heard from him, the way being
down the Grand Canal for some distance, under the Rialto, and then by
narrow canals which eventually brought us under the Bridge of Sighs&mdash;harmonious
to our moods!&mdash;and out again into open water.&nbsp; The scene was
purity itself as to colour, but it was cruel that I should behold it
for the first time under such circumstances.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the hotel, which is an old-fashioned place,
like most places here, where people are taken <i>en pension</i> as well
as the ordinary way, I rushed to the framed list of visitors hanging
in the hall, and in a moment I saw Charles&rsquo;s name upon it among
the rest.&nbsp; But she was our chief thought.&nbsp; I turned to the
hall porter, and&mdash;knowing that she would have travelled as &lsquo;Madame
de la Feste&rsquo;&mdash;I asked for her under that name, without my
father hearing.&nbsp; (He, poor soul, was making confused inquiries
outside the door about &lsquo;an English lady,&rsquo; as if there were
not a score of English ladies at hand.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has just come,&rsquo; said the porter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Madame
came by the very early train this morning, when Monsieur was asleep,
and she requested us not to disturb him.&nbsp; She is now in her room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether Caroline had seen us from the window, or overheard me, I
do not know, but at that moment I heard footsteps on the bare marble
stairs, and she appeared in person descending.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Caroline!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;why have you done this?&rsquo;
and rushed up to her.</p>
<p>She did not answer; but looked down to hide her emotion, which she
conquered after the lapse of a few seconds, putting on a practical tone
that belied her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am just going to my husband,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have not yet seen him.&nbsp; I have not been here long.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She condescended to give no further reason for her movements, and made
as if to move on.&nbsp; I implored her to come into a private room where
I could speak to her in confidence, but she objected.&nbsp; However,
the dining-room, close at hand, was quite empty at this hour, and I
got her inside and closed the door.&nbsp; I do not know how I began
my explanation, or how I ended it, but I told her briefly and brokenly
enough that the marriage was not real.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not real?&rsquo; she said vacantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will find that
it is all as I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not believe my meaning even then.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not his
wife?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is impossible.&nbsp; What am
I, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I added more details, and reiterated the reason for my conduct as
well as I could; but Heaven knows how very difficult I found it to feel
a jot more justification for it in my own mind than she did in hers.</p>
<p>The revulsion of feeling, as soon as she really comprehended all,
was most distressing.&nbsp; After her grief had in some measure spent
itself she turned against both him and me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should have I been deceived like this?&rsquo; she demanded,
with a bitter haughtiness of which I had not deemed such a tractable
creature capable.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you suppose that <i>anything</i> could
justify such an imposition?&nbsp; What, O what a snare you have spread
for me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I murmured, &lsquo;Your life seemed to require it,&rsquo; but she
did not hear me.&nbsp; She sank down in a chair, covered her face, and
then my father came in.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, here you are!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I could not find you.&nbsp; And Caroline!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And were <i>you</i>, papa, a party to this strange deed of
kindness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To what?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then out it all came, and for the first time he was made acquainted
with the fact that the scheme for soothing her illness, which I had
sounded him upon, had been really carried out.&nbsp; In a moment he
sided with Caroline.&nbsp; My repeated assurance that my motive was
good availed less than nothing.&nbsp; In a minute or two Caroline arose
and went abruptly out of the room, and my father followed her, leaving
me alone to my reflections.</p>
<p>I was so bent upon finding Charles immediately that I did not notice
whither they went.&nbsp; The servants told me that M. de la Feste was
just outside smoking, and one of them went to look for him, I following;
but before we had gone many steps he came out of the hotel behind me.&nbsp;
I expected him to be amazed; but he showed no surprise at seeing me,
though he showed another kind of feeling to an extent which dismayed
me.&nbsp; I may have revealed something similar; but I struggled hard
against all emotion, and as soon as I could I told him she had come.&nbsp;
He simply said &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in a low voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know it, Charles?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just learnt it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Charles,&rsquo; I went on, &lsquo;having delayed completing
your marriage with her till now, I fear&mdash;it has become a serious
position for us.&nbsp; Why did you not reply to our letters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was purposing to reply in person: I did not know how to
address her on the point&mdash;how to address you.&nbsp; But what has
become of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has gone off with my father,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;indignant
with you, and scorning me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent: and I suggested that we should follow them, pointing
out the direction which I fancied their gondola had taken.&nbsp; As
the one we got into was doubly manned we soon came in view of their
two figures ahead of us, while they were not likely to observe us, our
boat having the &lsquo;felze&rsquo; on, while theirs was uncovered.&nbsp;
They shot into a narrow canal just beyond the Giardino Reale, and by
the time we were floating up between its slimy walls we saw them getting
out of their gondola at the steps which lead up near the end of the
Via 22 Marzo.&nbsp; When we reached the same spot they were walking
up and down the Via in consultation.&nbsp; Getting out he stood on the
lower steps watching them.&nbsp; I watched him.&nbsp; He seemed to fall
into a reverie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you not go and speak to her?&rsquo; said I at length.</p>
<p>He assented, and went forward.&nbsp; Still he did not hasten to join
them, but, screened by a projecting window, observed their musing converse.&nbsp;
At last he looked back at me; whereupon I pointed forward, and he in
obedience stepped out, and met them face to face.&nbsp; Caroline flushed
hot, bowed haughtily to him, turned away, and taking my father&rsquo;s
arm violently, led him off before he had had time to use his own judgment.&nbsp;
They disappeared into a narrow <i>calle</i>, or alley, leading to the
back of the buildings on the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>M. de la Feste came slowly back; as he stepped in beside me I realized
my position so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to
beat.&nbsp; The third condition had arisen&mdash;the least expected
by either of us.&nbsp; She had refused him; he was free to claim me.</p>
<p>We returned in the boat together.&nbsp; He seemed quite absorbed
till we had turned the angle into the Grand Canal, when he broke the
silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;She spoke very bitterly to you in the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not think she was quite warranted in speaking
so to you, who had nursed her so tenderly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, but I think she was,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was there I told her what had been done; she did not know till then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was very dignified&mdash;very striking,&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You were more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how do you know what passed between us,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
He then told me that he had seen and heard all.&nbsp; The dining-room
was divided by folding-doors from an inner portion, and he had been
sitting in the latter part when we entered the outer, so that our words
were distinctly audible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, dear Alicia,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;I was more impressed
by the affection of your apology to her than by anything else.&nbsp;
And do you know that now the conditions have arisen which give me liberty
to consider you my affianced?&rsquo;&nbsp; I had been expecting this,
but yet was not prepared.&nbsp; I stammered out that we would not discuss
it then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know that we
may marry here and now?&nbsp; She has cast off both you and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be,&rsquo; said I, firmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has
not been fairly asked to be your wife in fact&mdash;to repeat the service
lawfully; and until that has been done it would be grievous sin in me
to accept you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had not noticed where the gondoliers were rowing us.&nbsp; I suppose
he had given them some direction unheard by me, for as I resigned myself
in despairing indolence to the motion of the gondola, I perceived that
it was taking us up the Canal, and, turning into a side opening near
the Palazzo Grimani, drew up at some steps near the end of a large church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the Church of the Frari,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
might be married there.&nbsp; At any rate, let us go inside, and grow
calm, and decide what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When we had entered I found that whether a place to marry in or not,
it was one to depress.&nbsp; The word which Venice speaks most constantly&mdash;decay&mdash;was
in a sense accentuated here.&nbsp; The whole large fabric itself seemed
sinking into an earth which was not solid enough to bear it.&nbsp; Cobwebbed
cracks zigzagged the walls, and similar webs clouded the window-panes.&nbsp;
A sickly-sweet smell pervaded the aisles.&nbsp; After walking about
with him a little while in embarrassing silences, divided only by his
cursory explanations of the monuments and other objects, and almost
fearing he might produce a marriage licence, I went to a door in the
south transept which opened into the sacristy.</p>
<p>I glanced through it, towards the small altar at the upper end.&nbsp;
The place was empty save of one figure; and she was kneeling here in
front of the beautiful altarpiece by Bellini.&nbsp; Beautiful though
it was she seemed not to see it.&nbsp; She was weeping and praying as
though her heart was broken.&nbsp; She was my sister Caroline.&nbsp;
I beckoned to Charles, and he came to my side, and looked through the
door with me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak to her,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;She will forgive
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I gently pushed him through the doorway, and went back into the transept,
down the nave, and onward to the west door.&nbsp; There I saw my father,
to whom I spoke.&nbsp; He answered severely that, having first obtained
comfortable quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal, he had gone back
to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me; but that I was
not there.&nbsp; He was now waiting for Caroline, to accompany her back
to the <i>pension</i>, at which she had requested to be left to herself
as much as possible till she could regain some composure.</p>
<p>I told him that it was useless to dwell on what was past, that I
no doubt had erred, that the remedy lay in the future and their marriage.&nbsp;
In this he quite agreed with me, and on my informing him that M. de
la Feste was at that moment with Caroline in the sacristy, he assented
to my proposal that we should leave them to themselves, and return together
to await them at the <i>pension</i>, where he had also engaged a room
for me.&nbsp; This we did, and going up to the chamber he had chosen
for me, which overlooked the Canal, I leant from the window to watch
for the gondola that should contain Charles and my sister.</p>
<p>They were not long in coming.&nbsp; I recognized them by the colour
of her sunshade as soon as they turned the bend on my right hand.&nbsp;
They were side by side of necessity, but there was no conversation between
them, and I thought that she looked flushed and he pale.&nbsp; When
they were rowed in to the steps of our house he handed her up.&nbsp;
I fancied she might have refused his assistance, but she did not.&nbsp;
Soon I heard her pass my door, and wishing to know the result of their
interview I went downstairs, seeing that the gondola had not put off
with him.&nbsp; He was turning from the door, but not towards the water,
intending apparently to walk home by way of the <i>calle</i> which led
into the Via 22 Marzo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she forgiven you?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not asked her,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are bound to do so,&rsquo; I told him.</p>
<p>He paused, and then said, &lsquo;Alicia, let us understand each other.&nbsp;
Do you mean to tell me, once for all, that if your sister is willing
to become my wife you absolutely make way for her, and will not entertain
any thought of what I suggested to you any more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do tell you so,&rsquo; said I with dry lips.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
belong to her&mdash;how can I do otherwise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it is so; it is purely a question of honour,&rsquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well then, honour shall be my word, and
not my love.&nbsp; I will put the question to her frankly; if she says
yes, the marriage shall be.&nbsp; But not here.&nbsp; It shall be at
your own house in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will accompany her there,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and
it shall be within a week of her return.&nbsp; I have nothing to gain
by delay.&nbsp; But I will not answer for the consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; He made no reply, went
away, and I came back to my room.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;SHE WITNESSES THE END</h3>
<p><i>April</i> 20.&nbsp; <i>Milan</i>, 10.30 <i>p.m</i>.&mdash;We are
thus far on our way homeward.&nbsp; I, being decidedly <i>de trop</i>,
travel apart from the rest as much as I can.&nbsp; Having dined at the
hotel here, I went out by myself; regardless of the proprieties, for
I could not stay in.&nbsp; I walked at a leisurely pace along the Via
Allesandro Manzoni till my eye was caught by the grand Galleria Vittorio
Emanuele, and I entered under the high glass arcades till I reached
the central octagon, where I sat down on one of a group of chairs placed
there.&nbsp; Becoming accustomed to the stream of promenaders, I soon
observed, seated on the chairs opposite, Caroline and Charles.&nbsp;
This was the first occasion on which I had seen them <i>en t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
since my conversation with him.&nbsp; She soon caught sight of me; averted
her eyes; then, apparently abandoning herself to an impulse, she jumped
up from her seat and came across to me.&nbsp; We had not spoken to each
other since the meeting in Venice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alicia,&rsquo; she said, sitting down by my side, &lsquo;Charles
asks me to forgive you, and I do forgive you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I pressed her hand, with tears in my eyes, and said, &lsquo;And do
you forgive him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she, shyly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what&rsquo;s the result?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are to be married directly we reach home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was almost the whole of our conversation; she walked home with
me, Charles following a little way behind, though she kept turning her
head, as if anxious that he should overtake us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Honour
and not love&rsquo; seemed to ring in my ears.&nbsp; So matters stand.&nbsp;
Caroline is again happy.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 25.&mdash;We have reached home, Charles with us.&nbsp;
Events are now moving in silent speed, almost with velocity, indeed;
and I sometimes feel oppressed by the strange and preternatural ease
which seems to accompany their flow.&nbsp; Charles is staying at the
neighbouring town; he is only waiting for the marriage licence; when
obtained he is to come here, be quietly married to her, and carry her
off.&nbsp; It is rather resignation than content which sits on his face;
but he has not spoken a word more to me on the burning subject, or deviated
one hair&rsquo;s breadth from the course he laid down.&nbsp; They may
be happy in time to come: I hope so.&nbsp; But I cannot shake off depression.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 6.&mdash;Eve of the wedding.&nbsp; Caroline is serenely
happy, though not blithe.&nbsp; But there is nothing to excite anxiety
about her.&nbsp; I wish I could say the same of him.&nbsp; He comes
and goes like a ghost, and yet nobody seems to observe this strangeness
in his mien.</p>
<p>I could not help being here for the ceremony; but my absence would
have resulted in less disquiet on his part, I believe.&nbsp; However,
I may be wrong in attributing causes: my father simply says that Charles
and Caroline have as good a chance of being happy as other people.&nbsp;
Well, to-morrow settles all.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 7.&mdash;They are married: we have just returned from
church.&nbsp; Charles looked so pale this morning that my father asked
him if he was ill.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;No: only a slight headache;&rsquo;
and we started for the church.</p>
<p>There was no hitch or hindrance; and the thing is done.</p>
<p>4 p.m.&mdash;They ought to have set out on their journey by this
time; but there is an unaccountable delay.&nbsp; Charles went out half-an-hour
ago, and has not yet returned.&nbsp; Caroline is waiting in the hall;
but I am dreadfully afraid they will miss the train.&nbsp; I suppose
the trifling hindrance is of no account; and yet I am full of misgivings
. . .</p>
<p><i>Sept</i>. 14.&mdash;Four months have passed; <i>only</i> four
months!&nbsp; It seems like years.&nbsp; Can it be that only seventeen
weeks ago I set on this paper the fact of their marriage?&nbsp; I am
now an aged woman by comparison!</p>
<p>On that never to be forgotten day we waited and waited, and Charles
did not return.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock, when poor little Caroline
had gone back to her room in a state of suspense impossible to describe,
a man who worked in the water-meadows came to the house and asked for
my father.&nbsp; He had an interview with him in the study.&nbsp; My
father then rang his bell, and sent for me.&nbsp; I went down; and I
then learnt the fatal news.&nbsp; Charles was no more.&nbsp; The waterman
had been going to shut down the hatches of a weir in the meads when
he saw a hat on the edge of the pool below, floating round and round
in the eddy, and looking into the pool saw something strange at the
bottom.&nbsp; He knew what it meant, and lowering the hatches so that
the water was still, could distinctly see the body.&nbsp; It is needless
to write particulars that were in the newspapers at the time.&nbsp;
Charles was brought to the house, but he was dead.</p>
<p>We all feared for Caroline; and she suffered much; but strange to
say, her suffering was purely of the nature of deep grief which found
relief in sobbing and tears.&nbsp; It came out at the inquest that Charles
had been accustomed to cross the meads to give an occasional half-crown
to an old man who lived on the opposite hill, who had once been a landscape
painter in an humble way till he lost his eyesight; and it was assumed
that he had gone thither for the same purpose to-day, and to bid him
farewell.&nbsp; On this information the coroner&rsquo;s jury found that
his death had been caused by misadventure; and everybody believes to
this hour that he was drowned while crossing the weir to relieve the
old man.&nbsp; Except one: she believes in no accident.&nbsp; After
the stunning effect of the first news, I thought it strange that he
should have chosen to go on such an errand at the last moment, and to
go personally, when there was so little time to spare, since any gift
could have been so easily sent by another hand.&nbsp; Further reflection
has convinced me that this step out of life was as much a part of the
day&rsquo;s plan as was the wedding in the church hard by.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They were the two halves of his complete intention when he gave me on
the Grand Canal that assurance which I shall never forget: &lsquo;Very
well, then; honour shall be my word, not love.&nbsp; If she says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
the marriage shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know why I should have made this entry at this particular
time; but it has occurred to me to do it&mdash;to complete, in a measure,
that part of my desultory chronicle which relates to the love-story
of my sister and Charles.&nbsp; She lives on meekly in her grief; and
will probably outlive it; while I&mdash;but never mind me.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.&mdash;SHE ADDS A NOTE LONG AFTER</h3>
<p><i>Five-years later.&mdash;</i>I have lighted upon this old diary,
which it has interested me to look over, containing, as it does, records
of the time when life shone more warmly in my eye than it does now.&nbsp;
I am impelled to add one sentence to round off its record of the past.&nbsp;
About a year ago my sister Caroline, after a persistent wooing, accepted
the hand and heart of Theophilus Higham, once the blushing young Scripture
reader who assisted at the substitute for a marriage I planned, and
now the fully-ordained curate of the next parish.&nbsp; His penitence
for the part he played ended in love.&nbsp; We have all now made atonement
for our sins against her: may she be deceived no more.</p>
<p>1887.</p>
<h2>THE GRAVE BY THE HANDPOST</h2>
<p>I never pass through Chalk-Newton without turning to regard the neighbouring
upland, at a point where a lane crosses the lone straight highway dividing
this from the next parish; a sight which does not fail to recall the
event that once happened there; and, though it may seem superfluous,
at this date, to disinter more memories of village history, the whispers
of that spot may claim to be preserved.</p>
<p>It was on a dark, yet mild and exceptionally dry evening at Christmas-time
(according to the testimony of William Dewy of Mellstock, Michael Mail,
and others), that the choir of Chalk-Newton&mdash;a large parish situate
about half-way between the towns of Ivel and Casterbridge, and now a
railway station&mdash;left their homes just before midnight to repeat
their annual harmonies under the windows of the local population.&nbsp;
The band of instrumentalists and singers was one of the largest in the
county; and, unlike the smaller and finer Mellstock string-band, which
eschewed all but the catgut, it included brass and reed performers at
full Sunday services, and reached all across the west gallery.</p>
<p>On this night there were two or three violins, two &lsquo;cellos,
a tenor viol, double bass, hautboy, clarionets, serpent, and seven singers.&nbsp;
It was, however, not the choir&rsquo;s labours, but what its members
chanced to witness, that particularly marked the occasion.</p>
<p>They had pursued their rounds for many years without meeting with
any incident of an unusual kind, but to-night, according to the assertions
of several, there prevailed, to begin with, an exceptionally solemn
and thoughtful mood among two or three of the oldest in the band, as
if they were thinking they might be joined by the phantoms of dead friends
who had been of their number in earlier years, and now were mute in
the churchyard under flattening mounds&mdash;friends who had shown greater
zest for melody in their time than was shown in this; or that some past
voice of a semi-transparent figure might quaver from some bedroom-window
its acknowledgment of their nocturnal greeting, instead of a familiar
living neighbour.&nbsp; Whether this were fact or fancy, the younger
members of the choir met together with their customary thoughtlessness
and buoyancy.&nbsp; When they had gathered by the stone stump of the
cross in the middle of the village, near the White Horse Inn, which
they made their starting point, some one observed that they were full
early, that it was not yet twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The local waits
of those days mostly refrained from sounding a note before Christmas
morning had astronomically arrived, and not caring to return to their
beer, they decided to begin with some outlying cottages in Sidlinch
Lane, where the people had no clocks, and would not know whether it
were night or morning.&nbsp; In that direction they accordingly went;
and as they ascended to higher ground their attention was attracted
by a light beyond the houses, quite at the top of the lane.</p>
<p>The road from Chalk-Newton to Broad Sidlinch is about two miles long
and in the middle of its course, where it passes over the ridge dividing
the two villages, it crosses at right angles, as has been stated, the
lonely monotonous old highway known as Long Ash Lane, which runs, straight
as a surveyor&rsquo;s line, many miles north and south of this spot,
on the foundation of a Roman road, and has often been mentioned in these
narratives.&nbsp; Though now quite deserted and grass-grown, at the
beginning of the century it was well kept and frequented by traffic.&nbsp;
The glimmering light appeared to come from the precise point where the
roads intersected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I know what that mid mean!&rsquo; one of the group
remarked.</p>
<p>They stood a few moments, discussing the probability of the light
having origin in an event of which rumours had reached them, and resolved
to go up the hill.</p>
<p>Approaching the high land their conjectures were strengthened.&nbsp;
Long Ash Lane cut athwart them, right and left; and they saw that at
the junction of the four ways, under the hand-post, a grave was dug,
into which, as the choir drew nigh, a corpse had just been thrown by
the four Sidlinch men employed for the purpose.&nbsp; The cart and horse
which had brought the body thither stood silently by.</p>
<p>The singers and musicians from Chalk-Newton halted, and looked on
while the gravediggers shovelled in and trod down the earth, till, the
hole being filled, the latter threw their spades into the cart, and
prepared to depart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who mid ye be a-burying there?&rsquo; asked Lot Swanhills
in a raised voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not the sergeant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sidlinch men had been so deeply engrossed in their task that
they had not noticed the lanterns of the Chalk-Newton choir till now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;be you the Newton carol-singers?&rsquo; returned
the representatives of Sidlinch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sure.&nbsp; Can it be that it is old Sergeant Holway you&rsquo;ve
a-buried there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis so.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard about it, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The choir knew no particulars&mdash;only that he had shot himself
in his apple-closet on the previous Sunday.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody seem&rsquo;th
to know what &lsquo;a did it for, &lsquo;a b&rsquo;lieve?&nbsp; Leastwise,
we don&rsquo;t know at Chalk-Newton,&rsquo; continued Lot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; It all came out at the inquest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The singers drew close, and the Sidlinch men, pausing to rest after
their labours, told the story.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was all owing to that
son of his, poor old man.&nbsp; It broke his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the son is a soldier, surely; now with his regiment in
the East Indies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay.&nbsp; And it have been rough with the army over there
lately.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a pity his father persuaded him to go.&nbsp;
But Luke shouldn&rsquo;t have twyted the sergeant o&rsquo;t, since &lsquo;a
did it for the best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The circumstances, in brief, were these: The sergeant who had come
to this lamentable end, father of the young soldier who had gone with
his regiment to the East, had been singularly comfortable in his military
experiences, these having ended long before the outbreak of the great
war with France.&nbsp; On his discharge, after duly serving his time,
he had returned to his native village, and married, and taken kindly
to domestic life.&nbsp; But the war in which England next involved herself
had cost him many frettings that age and infirmity prevented him from
being ever again an active unit of the army.&nbsp; When his only son
grew to young manhood, and the question arose of his going out in life,
the lad expressed his wish to be a mechanic.&nbsp; But his father advised
enthusiastically for the army.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trade is coming to nothing in these days,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And if the war with the French lasts, as it will, trade will
be still worse.&nbsp; The army, Luke&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing for
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the making of me, and &rsquo;twill be the
making of you.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t half such a chance as you&rsquo;ll
have in these splendid hotter times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Luke demurred, for he was a home-keeping, peace-loving youth.&nbsp;
But, putting respectful trust in his father&rsquo;s judgment, he at
length gave way, and enlisted in the ---d Foot.&nbsp; In the course
of a few weeks he was sent out to India to his regiment, which had distinguished
itself in the East under General Wellesley.</p>
<p>But Luke was unlucky.&nbsp; News came home indirectly that he lay
sick out there; and then on one recent day when his father was out walking,
the old man had received tidings that a letter awaited him at Casterbridge.&nbsp;
The sergeant sent a special messenger the whole nine miles, and the
letter was paid for and brought home; but though, as he had guessed,
it came from Luke, its contents were of an unexpected tenor.</p>
<p>The letter had been written during a time of deep depression.&nbsp;
Luke said that his life was a burden and a slavery, and bitterly reproached
his father for advising him to embark on a career for which he felt
unsuited.&nbsp; He found himself suffering fatigues and illnesses without
gaining glory, and engaged in a cause which he did not understand or
appreciate.&nbsp; If it had not been for his father&rsquo;s bad advice
he, Luke, would now have been working comfortably at a trade in the
village that he had never wished to leave.</p>
<p>After reading the letter the sergeant advanced a few steps till he
was quite out of sight of everybody, and then sat down on the bank by
the wayside.</p>
<p>When he arose half-an-hour later he looked withered and broken, and
from that day his natural spirits left him.&nbsp; Wounded to the quick
by his son&rsquo;s sarcastic stings, he indulged in liquor more and
more frequently.&nbsp; His wife had died some years before this date,
and the sergeant lived alone in the house which had been hers.&nbsp;
One morning in the December under notice the report of a gun had been
heard on his premises, and on entering the neighbours found him in a
dying state.&nbsp; He had shot himself with an old firelock that he
used for scaring birds; and from what he had said the day before, and
the arrangements he had made for his decease, there was no doubt that
his end had been deliberately planned, as a consequence of the despondency
into which he had been thrown by his son&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; The coroner&rsquo;s
jury returned a verdict of <i>felo de se.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s his son&rsquo;s letter,&rsquo; said one of the
Sidlinch men.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas found in his father&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp;
You can see by the state o&rsquo;t how many times he read it over.&nbsp;
Howsomever, the Lord&rsquo;s will be done, since it must, whether or
no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grave was filled up and levelled, no mound being shaped over
it.&nbsp; The Sidlinch men then bade the Chalk-Newton choir good-night,
and departed with the cart in which they had brought the sergeant&rsquo;s
body to the hill.&nbsp; When their tread had died away from the ear,
and the wind swept over the isolated grave with its customary siffle
of indifference, Lot Swanhills turned and spoke to old Richard Toller,
the hautboy player.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hard upon a man, and he a wold sojer, to serve
en so, Richard.&nbsp; Not that the sergeant was ever in a battle bigger
than would go into a half-acre paddock, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Still,
his soul ought to hae as good a chance as another man&rsquo;s, all the
same, hey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard replied that he was quite of the same opinion.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
d&rsquo;ye say to lifting up a carrel over his grave, as &rsquo;tis
Christmas, and no hurry to begin down in parish, and &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t
take up ten minutes, and not a soul up here to say us nay, or know anything
about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lot nodded assent.&nbsp; &lsquo;The man ought to hae his chances,&rsquo;
he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye may as well spet upon his grave, for all the good we shall
do en by what we lift up, now he&rsquo;s got so far,&rsquo; said Notton,
the clarionet man and professed sceptic of the choir.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I&rsquo;m agreed if the rest be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They thereupon placed themselves in a semicircle by the newly stirred
earth, and roused the dull air with the well-known Number Sixteen of
their collection, which Lot gave out as being the one he thought best
suited to the occasion and the mood</p>
<blockquote><p>He comes&rsquo; the pri&rsquo;-soners to&rsquo; re-lease&rsquo;,<br />
In Sa&rsquo;-tan&rsquo;s bon&rsquo;-dage held&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Jown it&mdash;we&rsquo;ve never played to a dead man afore,&rsquo;
said Ezra Cattstock, when, having concluded the last verse, they stood
reflecting for a breath or two.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it do seem more merciful
than to go away and leave en, as they t&rsquo;other fellers have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now backalong to Newton, and by the time we get overright
the pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s &rsquo;twill be half after twelve,&rsquo; said
the leader.</p>
<p>They had not, however, done more than gather up their instruments
when the wind brought to their notice the noise of a vehicle rapidly
driven up the same lane from Sidlinch which the gravediggers had lately
retraced.&nbsp; To avoid being run over when moving on, they waited
till the benighted traveller, whoever he might be, should pass them
where they stood in the wider area of the Cross.</p>
<p>In half a minute the light of the lanterns fell upon a hired fly,
drawn by a steaming and jaded horse.&nbsp; It reached the hand-post,
when a voice from the inside cried, &lsquo;Stop here!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
driver pulled rein.&nbsp; The carriage door was opened from within,
and there leapt out a private soldier in the uniform of some line regiment.&nbsp;
He looked around, and was apparently surprised to see the musicians
standing there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you buried a man here?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; We bain&rsquo;t Sidlinch folk, thank God; we be
Newton choir.&nbsp; Though a man is just buried here, that&rsquo;s true;
and we&rsquo;ve raised a carrel over the poor mortal&rsquo;s natomy.&nbsp;
What&mdash;do my eyes see before me young Luke Holway, that went wi&rsquo;
his regiment to the East Indies, or do I see his spirit straight from
the battlefield?&nbsp; Be you the son that wrote the letter&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me.&nbsp; The funeral is
over, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There wer no funeral, in a Christen manner of speaking.&nbsp;
But&rsquo;s buried, sure enough.&nbsp; You must have met the men going
back in the empty cart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a dog in a ditch, and all through me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He remained silent, looking at the grave, and they could not help
pitying him.&nbsp; &lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I understand
better now.&nbsp; You have, I suppose, in neighbourly charity, sung
peace to his soul?&nbsp; I thank you, from my heart, for your kind pity.&nbsp;
Yes; I am Sergeant Holway&rsquo;s miserable son&mdash;I&rsquo;m the
son who has brought about his father&rsquo;s death, as truly as if I
had done it with my own hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye take on so, young man.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d been naturally low for a good while, off and on, so we hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were out in the East when I wrote to him.&nbsp; Everything
had seemed to go wrong with me.&nbsp; Just after my letter had gone
we were ordered home.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how it is you see me here.&nbsp;
As soon as we got into barracks at Casterbridge I heard o&rsquo; this
. . . Damn me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll dare to follow my father, and make away
with myself, too.&nbsp; It is the only thing left to do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be rash, Luke Holway, I say again; but try
to make amends by your future life.&nbsp; And maybe your father will
smile a smile down from heaven upon &rsquo;ee for &lsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that!&rsquo;
he answered bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Try and be worthy of your father at his best.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
not too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;ye think not?&nbsp; I fancy it is! . . . Well, I&rsquo;ll
turn it over.&nbsp; Thank you for your good counsel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
live for one thing, at any rate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll move father&rsquo;s
body to a decent Christian churchyard, if I do it with my own hands.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t save his life, but I can give him an honourable grave.&nbsp;
He shan&rsquo;t lie in this accursed place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, as our pa&rsquo;son says, &rsquo;tis a barbarous custom
they keep up at Sidlinch, and ought to be done away wi&rsquo;.&nbsp;
The man a&rsquo; old soldier, too.&nbsp; You see, our pa&rsquo;son is
not like yours at Sidlinch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says it is barbarous, does he?&nbsp; So it is!&rsquo; cried
the soldier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now hearken, my friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
he proceeded to inquire if they would increase his indebtedness to them
by undertaking the removal, privately, of the body of the suicide to
the churchyard, not of Sidlinch, a parish he now hated, but of Chalk-Newton.&nbsp;
He would give them all he possessed to do it.</p>
<p>Lot asked Ezra Cattstock what he thought of it.</p>
<p>Cattstock, the &lsquo;cello player, who was also the sexton, demurred,
and advised the young soldier to sound the rector about it first.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mid be he would object, and yet &lsquo;a mid&rsquo;nt.&nbsp;
The pa&rsquo;son o&rsquo; Sidlinch is a hard man, I own ye, and &lsquo;a
said if folk will kill theirselves in hot blood they must take the consequences.&nbsp;
But ours don&rsquo;t think like that at all, and might allow it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The honourable and reverent Mr. Oldham, brother to Lord Wessex.&nbsp;
But you needn&rsquo;t be afeard o&rsquo; en on that account.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
talk to &rsquo;ee like a common man, if so be you haven&rsquo;t had
enough drink to gie &rsquo;ee bad breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, the same as formerly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask him.&nbsp; Thank
you.&nbsp; And that duty done&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s war in Spain.&nbsp; I hear our next move is
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try to show myself to be what my father wished
me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll try in
my feeble way.&nbsp; That much I swear&mdash;here over his body.&nbsp;
So help me God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Luke smacked his palm against the white hand-post with such force
that it shook.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s war in Spain; and another
chance for me to be worthy of father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the matter ended that night.&nbsp; That the private acted in one
thing as he had vowed to do soon became apparent, for during the Christmas
week the rector came into the churchyard when Cattstock was there, and
asked him to find a spot that would be suitable for the purpose of such
an interment, adding that he had slightly known the late sergeant, and
was not aware of any law which forbade him to assent to the removal,
the letter of the rule having been observed.&nbsp; But as he did not
wish to seem moved by opposition to his neighbour at Sidlinch, he had
stipulated that the act of charity should be carried out at night, and
as privately as possible, and that the grave should be in an obscure
part of the enclosure.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had better see the young man
about it at once,&rsquo; added the rector.</p>
<p>But before Ezra had done anything Luke came down to his house.&nbsp;
His furlough had been cut short, owing to new developments of the war
in the Peninsula, and being obliged to go back to his regiment immediately,
he was compelled to leave the exhumation and reinterment to his friends.&nbsp;
Everything was paid for, and he implored them all to see it carried
out forthwith.</p>
<p>With this the soldier left.&nbsp; The next day Ezra, on thinking
the matter over, again went across to the rectory, struck with sudden
misgiving.&nbsp; He had remembered that the sergeant had been buried
without a coffin, and he was not sure that a stake had not been driven
through him.&nbsp; The business would be more troublesome than they
had at first supposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed!&rsquo; murmured the rector.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
afraid it is not feasible after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next event was the arrival of a headstone by carrier from the
nearest town; to be left at Mr. Ezra Cattstock&rsquo;s; all expenses
paid.&nbsp; The sexton and the carrier deposited the stone in the former&rsquo;s
outhouse; and Ezra, left alone, put on his spectacles and read the brief
and simple inscription:-</p>
<blockquote><p>HERE LYETH THE BODY OF SAMUEL HOLWAY, LATE SERGEANT IN
HIS MAJESTY&rsquo;S ---D REGIMENT OF FOOT, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE DECEMBER
THE 20TH, 180-.&nbsp; ERECTED BY L. H.<br />
&lsquo;I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ezra again called at the riverside rectory.&nbsp; &lsquo;The stone
is come, sir.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afeard we can&rsquo;t do it nohow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to oblige him,&rsquo; said the gentlemanly old
incumbent.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I would forego all fees willingly.&nbsp;
Still, if you and the others don&rsquo;t think you can carry it out,
I am in doubt what to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, sir; I&rsquo;ve made inquiry of a Sidlinch woman as to his
burial, and what I thought seems true.&nbsp; They buried en wi&rsquo;
a new six-foot hurdle-saul drough&rsquo;s body, from the sheep-pen up
in North Ewelease though they won&rsquo;t own to it now.&nbsp; And the
question is, Is the moving worth while, considering the awkwardness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you heard anything more of the young man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ezra had only heard that he had embarked that week for Spain with
the rest of the regiment.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if he&rsquo;s as desperate
as &lsquo;a seemed, we shall never see him here in England again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is an awkward case,&rsquo; said the rector.</p>
<p>Ezra talked it over with the choir; one of whom suggested that the
stone might be erected at the crossroads.&nbsp; This was regarded as
impracticable.&nbsp; Another said that it might be set up in the churchyard
without removing the body; but this was seen to be dishonest.&nbsp;
So nothing was done.</p>
<p>The headstone remained in Ezra&rsquo;s outhouse till, growing tired
of seeing it there, he put it away among the bushes at the bottom of
his garden.&nbsp; The subject was sometimes revived among them, but
it always ended with: &lsquo;Considering how &lsquo;a was buried, we
can hardly make a job o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was always the consciousness that Luke would never come back,
an impression strengthened by the disasters which were rumoured to have
befallen the army in Spain.&nbsp; This tended to make their inertness
permanent.&nbsp; The headstone grew green as it lay on its back under
Ezra&rsquo;s bushes; then a tree by the river was blown down, and, falling
across the stone, cracked it in three pieces.&nbsp; Ultimately the pieces
became buried in the leaves and mould.</p>
<p>Luke had not been born a Chalk-Newton man, and he had no relations
left in Sidlinch, so that no tidings of him reached either village throughout
the war.&nbsp; But after Waterloo and the fall of Napoleon there arrived
at Sidlinch one day an English sergeant-major covered with stripes and,
as it turned out, rich in glory.&nbsp; Foreign service had so totally
changed Luke Holway that it was not until he told his name that the
inhabitants recognized him as the sergeant&rsquo;s only son.</p>
<p>He had served with unswerving effectiveness through the Peninsular
campaigns under Wellington; had fought at Busaco, Fuentes d&rsquo;Onore,
Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vittoria, Quatre Bras, and Waterloo;
and had now returned to enjoy a more than earned pension and repose
in his native district.</p>
<p>He hardly stayed in Sidlinch longer than to take a meal on his arrival.&nbsp;
The same evening he started on foot over the hill to Chalk-Newton, passing
the hand-post, and saying as he glanced at the spot, &lsquo;Thank God:
he&rsquo;s not there!&rsquo;&nbsp; Nightfall was approaching when he
reached the latter village; but he made straight for the churchyard.&nbsp;
On his entering it there remained light enough to discern the headstones
by, and these he narrowly scanned.&nbsp; But though he searched the
front part by the road, and the back part by the river, what he sought
he could not find&mdash;the grave of Sergeant Holway, and a memorial
bearing the inscription: &lsquo;I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He left the churchyard and made inquiries.&nbsp; The honourable and
reverend old rector was dead, and so were many of the choir; but by
degrees the sergeant-major learnt that his father still lay at the cross-roads
in Long Ash Lane.</p>
<p>Luke pursued his way moodily homewards, to do which, in the natural
course, he would be compelled to repass the spot, there being no other
road between the two villages.&nbsp; But he could not now go by that
place, vociferous with reproaches in his father&rsquo;s tones; and he
got over the hedge and wandered deviously through the ploughed fields
to avoid the scene.&nbsp; Through many a fight and fatigue Luke had
been sustained by the thought that he was restoring the family honour
and making noble amends.&nbsp; Yet his father lay still in degradation.&nbsp;
It was rather a sentiment than a fact that his father&rsquo;s body had
been made to suffer for his own misdeeds; but to his super-sensitiveness
it seemed that his efforts to retrieve his character and to propitiate
the shade of the insulted one had ended in failure.</p>
<p>He endeavoured, however, to shake off his lethargy, and, not liking
the associations of Sidlinch, hired a small cottage at Chalk-Newton
which had long been empty.&nbsp; Here he lived alone, becoming quite
a hermit, and allowing no woman to enter the house.</p>
<p>The Christmas after taking up his abode herein he was sitting in
the chimney corner by himself, when he heard faint notes in the distance,
and soon a melody burst forth immediately outside his own window, it
came from the carol-singers, as usual; and though many of the old hands,
Ezra and Lot included, had gone to their rest, the same old carols were
still played out of the same old books.&nbsp; There resounded through
the sergeant-major&rsquo;s window-shutters the familiar lines that the
deceased choir had rendered over his father&rsquo;s grave:-</p>
<blockquote><p>He comes&rsquo; the pri&rsquo;-soners to&rsquo; re-lease&rsquo;,<br />
In Sa&rsquo;-tan&rsquo;s bon&rsquo;-dage held&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they had finished they went on to another house, leaving him
to silence and loneliness as before.</p>
<p>The candle wanted snuffing, but he did not snuff it, and he sat on
till it had burnt down into the socket and made waves of shadow on the
ceiling.</p>
<p>The Christmas cheerfulness of next morning was broken at breakfast-time
by tragic intelligence which went down the village like wind.&nbsp;
Sergeant-Major Holway had been found shot through the head by his own
hand at the cross-roads in Long Ash Lane where his father lay buried.</p>
<p>On the table in the cottage he had left a piece of paper, on which
he had written his wish that he might be buried at the Cross beside
his father.&nbsp; But the paper was accidentally swept to the floor,
and overlooked till after his funeral, which took place in the ordinary
way in the churchyard.</p>
<p>Christmas 1897.</p>
<h2>ENTER A DRAGOON</h2>
<p>I lately had a melancholy experience (said the gentleman who is answerable
for the truth of this story).&nbsp; It was that of going over a doomed
house with whose outside aspect I had long been familiar&mdash;a house,
that is, which by reason of age and dilapidation was to be pulled down
during the following week.&nbsp; Some of the thatch, brown and rotten
as the gills of old mushrooms, had, indeed, been removed before I walked
over the building.&nbsp; Seeing that it was only a very small house&mdash;which
is usually called a &lsquo;cottage-residence&rsquo;&mdash;situated in
a remote hamlet, and that it was not more than a hundred years old,
if so much, I was led to think in my progress through the hollow rooms,
with their cracked walls and sloping floors, what an exceptional number
of abrupt family incidents had taken place therein&mdash;to reckon only
those which had come to my own knowledge.&nbsp; And no doubt there were
many more of which I had never heard.</p>
<p>It stood at the top of a garden stretching down to the lane or street
that ran through a hermit-group of dwellings in Mellstock parish.&nbsp;
From a green gate at the lower entrance, over which the thorn hedge
had been shaped to an arch by constant clippings, a gravel path ascended
between the box edges of once trim raspberry, strawberry, and vegetable
plots, towards the front door.&nbsp; This was in colour an ancient and
bleached green that could be rubbed off with the finger, and it bore
a small long-featured brass knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices.&nbsp;
For some years before this eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated,
and been divided into two tenements to serve as cottages for farm labourers;
but in its prime it had indisputable claim to be considered neat, pretty,
and genteel.</p>
<p>The variety of incidents above alluded to was mainly owing to the
nature of the tenure, whereby the place had been occupied by families
not quite of the kind customary in such spots&mdash;people whose circumstances,
position, or antecedents were more or less of a critical happy-go-lucky
cast.&nbsp; And of these residents the family whose term comprised the
story I wish to relate was that of Mr. Jacob Paddock the market-gardener,
who dwelt there for some years with his wife and grown-up daughter.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>An evident commotion was agitating the premises, which jerked busy
sounds across the front plot, resembling those of a disturbed hive.&nbsp;
If a member of the household appeared at the door it was with a countenance
of abstraction and concern.</p>
<p>Evening began to bend over the scene; and the other inhabitants of
the hamlet came out to draw water, their common well being in the public
road opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks.&nbsp; Having wound
up their bucketsfull respectively they lingered, and spoke significantly
together.&nbsp; From their words any casual listener might have gathered
information of what had occurred.</p>
<p>The woodman who lived nearest the site of the story told most of
the tale.&nbsp; Selina, the daughter of the Paddocks opposite, had been
surprised that afternoon by receiving a letter from her once intended
husband, then a corporal, but now a sergeant-major of dragoons, whom
she had hitherto supposed to be one of the slain in the Battle of the
Alma two or three years before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She picked up wi&rsquo;en against her father&rsquo;s wish,
as we know, and before he got his stripes,&rsquo; their informant continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not but that the man was as hearty a feller as you&rsquo;d meet
this side o&rsquo; London.&nbsp; But Jacob, you see, wished her to do
better, and one can understand it.&nbsp; However, she was determined
to stick to him at that time; and for what happened she was not much
to blame, so near as they were to matrimony when the war broke out and
spoiled all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even the very pig had been killed for the wedding,&rsquo;
said a woman, &lsquo;and the barrel o&rsquo; beer ordered in.&nbsp;
O, the man meant honourable enough.&nbsp; But to be off in two days
to fight in a foreign country&mdash;&rsquo;twas natural of her father
to say they should wait till he got back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he never came,&rsquo; murmured one in the shade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The war ended but her man never turned up again.&nbsp; She
was not sure he was killed, but was too proud, or too timid, to go and
hunt for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One reason why her father forgave her when he found out how
matters stood was, as he said plain at the time, that he liked the man,
and could see that he meant to act straight.&nbsp; So the old folks
made the best of what they couldn&rsquo;t mend, and kept her there with
&rsquo;em, when some wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Time has proved seemingly
that he did mean to act straight, now that he has writ to her that he&rsquo;s
coming.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d have stuck to him all through the time, &rsquo;tis
my belief; if t&rsquo;other hadn&rsquo;t come along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the time of the courtship,&rsquo; resumed the woodman,
&lsquo;the regiment was quartered in Casterbridge Barracks, and he and
she got acquainted by his calling to buy a penn&rsquo;orth of rathe-ripes
off that tree yonder in her father&rsquo;s orchard&mdash;though &rsquo;twas
said he seed <i>her</i> over hedge as well as the apples.&nbsp; He declared
&rsquo;twas a kind of apple he much fancied; and he called for a penn&rsquo;orth
every day till the tree was cleared.&nbsp; It ended in his calling for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a thousand pities they didn&rsquo;t jine up at
once and ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo; it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; better late than never, if so be he&rsquo;ll have her
now.&nbsp; But, Lord, she&rsquo;d that faith in &lsquo;en that she&rsquo;d
no more belief that he was alive, when a&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t come, than
that the undermost man in our churchyard was alive.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
never have thought of another but for that&mdash;O no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis awkward, altogether, for her now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still she hadn&rsquo;t married wi&rsquo; the new man.&nbsp;
Though to be sure she would have committed it next week, even the licence
being got, they say, for she&rsquo;d have no banns this time, the first
being so unfortunate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps the sergeant-major will think he&rsquo;s released,
and go as he came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, not as I reckon.&nbsp; Soldiers bain&rsquo;t particular,
and she&rsquo;s a tidy piece o&rsquo; furniture still.&nbsp; What will
happen is that she&rsquo;ll have her soldier, and break off with the
master-wheelwright, licence or no&mdash;daze me if she won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the progress of these desultory conjectures the form of another
neighbour arose in the gloom.&nbsp; She nodded to the people at the
well, who replied &lsquo;G&rsquo;d night, Mrs. Stone,&rsquo; as she
passed through Mr. Paddock&rsquo;s gate towards his door.&nbsp; She
was an intimate friend of the latter&rsquo;s household, and the group
followed her with their eyes up the path and past the windows, which
were now lighted up by candles inside.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Mrs. Stone paused at the door, knocked, and was admitted by Selina&rsquo;s
mother, who took her visitor at once into the parlour on the left hand,
where a table was partly spread for supper.&nbsp; On the &lsquo;beaufet&rsquo;
against the wall stood probably the only object which would have attracted
the eye of a local stranger in an otherwise ordinarily furnished room,
a great plum-cake guarded as if it were a curiosity by a glass shade
of the kind seen in museums&mdash;square, with a wooden back like those
enclosing stuffed specimens of rare feather or fur.&nbsp; This was the
mummy of the cake intended in earlier days for the wedding-feast of
Selina and the soldier, which had been religiously and lovingly preserved
by the former as a testimony to her intentional respectability in spite
of an untoward subsequent circumstance, which will be mentioned.&nbsp;
This relic was now as dry as a brick, and seemed to belong to a pre-existent
civilization.&nbsp; Till quite recently, Selina had been in the habit
of pausing before it daily, and recalling the accident whose consequences
had thrown a shadow over her life ever since&mdash;that of which the
water-drawers had spoken&mdash;the sudden news one morning that the
Route had come for the ---th Dragoons, two days only being the interval
before departure; the hurried consultation as to what should be done,
the second time of asking being past but not the third; and the decision
that it would be unwise to solemnize matrimony in such haphazard circumstances,
even if it were possible, which was doubtful.</p>
<p>Before the fire the young woman in question was now seated on a low
stool, in the stillness of reverie, and a toddling boy played about
the floor around her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Mrs. Stone!&rsquo; said Selina, rising slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
kind of you to come in.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll bide to supper?&nbsp; Mother
has told you the strange news, of course?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; But I heard it outside, that is, that you&rsquo;d
had a letter from Mr. Clark&mdash;Sergeant-Major Clark, as they say
he is now&mdash;and that he&rsquo;s coming to make it up with &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; coming to-night&mdash;all the way from the north of England
where he&rsquo;s quartered.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m
happy or&mdash;frightened at it.&nbsp; Of course I always believed that
if he was alive he&rsquo;d come and keep his solemn vow to me.&nbsp;
But when it is printed that a man is killed&mdash;what can you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It <i>was</i> printed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; After the Battle of the Alma the book of the
names of the killed and wounded was nailed up against Casterbridge Town
Hall door.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas on a Saturday, and I walked there o&rsquo;
purpose to read and see for myself; for I&rsquo;d heard that his name
was down.&nbsp; There was a crowd of people round the book, looking
for the names of relations; and I can mind that when they saw me they
made way for me&mdash;knowing that we&rsquo;d been just going to be
married&mdash;and that, as you may say, I belonged to him.&nbsp; Well,
I reached up my arm, and turned over the farrels of the book, and under
the &ldquo;killed&rdquo; I read his surname, but instead of &ldquo;John&rdquo;
they&rsquo;d printed &ldquo;James,&rdquo; and I thought &rsquo;twas
a mistake, and that it must be he.&nbsp; Who could have guessed there
were two nearly of one name in one regiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming to finish the wedding of &rsquo;ee
as may be said; so never mind, my dear.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s well that
ends well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what he seems to say.&nbsp; But then he has not
heard yet about Mr. Miller; and that&rsquo;s what rather terrifies me.&nbsp;
Luckily my marriage with him next week was to have been by licence,
and not banns, as in John&rsquo;s case; and it was not so well known
on that account.&nbsp; Still, I don&rsquo;t know what to think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything seems to come just &rsquo;twixt cup and lip with
&rsquo;ee, don&rsquo;t it now, Miss Paddock.&nbsp; Two weddings broke
off&mdash;&rsquo;tis odd!&nbsp; How came you to accept Mr. Miller, my
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been so good and faithful!&nbsp; Not minding about
the child at all; for he knew the rights of the story.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
dearly fond o&rsquo; Johnny, you know&mdash;just as if &rsquo;twere
his own&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he, my duck?&nbsp; Do Mr. Miller love you
or don&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Iss!&nbsp; An&rsquo; I love Mr. Miller,&rsquo; said the toddler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see, Mrs. Stone, he said he&rsquo;d make me a comfortable
home; and thinking &rsquo;twould be a good thing for Johnny, Mr. Miller
being so much better off than me, I agreed at last, just as a widow
might&mdash;which is what I have always felt myself; ever since I saw
what I thought was John&rsquo;s name printed there.&nbsp; I hope John
will forgive me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he will forgive &rsquo;ee, since &rsquo;twas no manner
of wrong to him.&nbsp; He ought to have sent &rsquo;ee a line, saying
&rsquo;twas another man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Selina&rsquo;s mother entered.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve not known
of this an hour, Mrs. Stone,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The letter
was brought up from Lower Mellstock Post-office by one of the school
children, only this afternoon.&nbsp; Mr. Miller was coming here this
very night to settle about the wedding doings.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; Is
that your father?&nbsp; Or is it Mr. Miller already come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The footsteps entered the porch; there was a brushing on the mat,
and the door of the room sprung back to disclose a rubicund man about
thirty years of age, of thriving master-mechanic appearance and obviously
comfortable temper.&nbsp; On seeing the child, and before taking any
notice whatever of the elders, the comer made a noise like the crowing
of a cock and flapped his arms as if they were wings, a method of entry
which had the unqualified admiration of Johnny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;it is he,&rsquo; said Selina constrainedly advancing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;were you all talking about me, my dear?&rsquo;
said the genial young man when he had finished his crowing and resumed
human manners.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why what&rsquo;s the matter,&rsquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;You look struck all of a heap.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Miller
spread an aspect of concern over his own face, and drew a chair up to
the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O mother, would you tell Mr. Miller, if he don&rsquo;t know?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;Mister</i> Miller! and going to be married in six days!&rsquo;
he interposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;he don&rsquo;t know it yet!&rsquo; murmured Mrs.
Paddock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;John Clark&mdash;now Sergeant-Major Clark&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
shot at Alma after all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas another of almost the same
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s interesting!&nbsp; There were several cases
like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he&rsquo;s home again; and he&rsquo;s coming here to-night
to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever shall I say, that he may not be offended with what
I&rsquo;ve done?&rsquo; interposed Selina.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should it matter if he be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; I must agree to be his wife if he forgives me&mdash;of
course I must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must!&nbsp; But why not say nay, Selina, even if he do forgive
&rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&nbsp; How can I without being wicked?&nbsp; You were
very very kind, Mr. Miller, to ask me to have you; no other man would
have done it after what had happened; and I agreed, even though I did
not feel half so warm as I ought.&nbsp; Yet it was entirely owing to
my believing him in the grave, as I knew that if he were not he would
carry out his promise; and this shows that I was right in trusting him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . He must be a goodish sort of fellow,&rsquo; said
Mr. Miller, for a moment so impressed with the excellently faithful
conduct of the sergeant-major of dragoons that he disregarded its effect
upon his own position.&nbsp; He sighed slowly and added, &lsquo;Well,
Selina, &rsquo;tis for you to say.&nbsp; I love you, and I love the
boy; and there&rsquo;s my chimney-corner and sticks o&rsquo; furniture
ready for &rsquo;ee both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know!&nbsp; But I mustn&rsquo;t hear it any more now,&rsquo;
murmured Selina quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;John will be here soon.&nbsp;
I hope he&rsquo;ll see how it all was when I tell him.&nbsp; If so be
I could have written it to him it would have been better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think he doesn&rsquo;t know a single word about our having
been on the brink o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But perhaps it&rsquo;s the other
way&mdash;he&rsquo;s heard of it and that may have brought him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;perhaps he has!&rsquo; she said brightening.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And already forgives me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not, speak out straight and fair, and tell him exactly
how it fell out.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s a man he&rsquo;ll see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O he&rsquo;s a man true enough.&nbsp; But I really do think
I shan&rsquo;t have to tell him at all, since you&rsquo;ve put it to
me that way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As it was now Johnny&rsquo;s bedtime he was carried upstairs, and
when Selina came down again her mother observed with some anxiety, &lsquo;I
fancy Mr. Clark must be here soon if he&rsquo;s coming; and that being
so, perhaps Mr. Miller wouldn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;wishing us good-night!
since you are so determined to stick to your sergeant-major.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A little bitterness bubbled amid the closing words.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
would be less awkward, Mr. Miller not being here&mdash;if he will allow
me to say it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure; to be sure,&rsquo; the master-wheelwright exclaimed
with instant conviction, rising alertly from his chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord
bless my soul,&rsquo; he said, taking up his hat and stick, &lsquo;and
we to have been married in six days!&nbsp; But Selina&mdash;you&rsquo;re
right.&nbsp; You do belong to the child&rsquo;s father since he&rsquo;s
alive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try to make the best of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before the generous Miller had got further there came a knock to
the door accompanied by the noise of wheels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I heard something driving up!&rsquo; said Mrs Paddock.</p>
<p>They heard Mr. Paddock, who had been smoking in the room opposite,
rise and go to the door, and in a moment a voice familiar enough to
Selina was audibly saying, &lsquo;At last I am here again&mdash;not
without many interruptions!&nbsp; How is it with &rsquo;ee, Mr. Paddock?&nbsp;
And how is she?&nbsp; Thought never to see me again, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A step with a clink of spurs in it struck upon the entry floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Danged if I bain&rsquo;t catched!&rsquo; murmured Mr. Miller,
forgetting company-speech.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind&mdash;I may as well
meet him here as elsewhere; and I should like to see the chap, and make
friends with en, as he seems one o&rsquo; the right sort.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He returned to the fireplace just as the sergeant-major was ushered
in.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>He was a good specimen of the long-service soldier of those days;
a not unhandsome man, with a certain undemonstrative dignity, which
some might have said to be partly owing to the stiffness of his uniform
about his neck, the high stock being still worn.&nbsp; He was much stouter
than when Selina had parted from him.&nbsp; Although she had not meant
to be demonstrative she ran across to him directly she saw him, and
he held her in his arms and kissed her.</p>
<p>Then in much agitation she whispered something to him, at which he
seemed to be much surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just put to bed,&rsquo; she continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
can go up and see him.&nbsp; I knew you&rsquo;d come if you were alive!&nbsp;
But I had quite gi&rsquo;d you up for dead.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been
home in England ever since the war ended?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come sooner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I ask myself!&nbsp; Why was I such
a sappy as not to hurry here the first day I set foot on shore!&nbsp;
Well, who&rsquo;d have thought it&mdash;you are as pretty as ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He relinquished her to peep upstairs a little way, where, by looking
through the ballusters, he could see Johnny&rsquo;s cot just within
an open door.&nbsp; On his stepping down again Mr. Miller was preparing
to depart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; I am sorry to see anybody going
the moment I&rsquo;ve come,&rsquo; expostulated the sergeant-major.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought we might make an evening of it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
a nine gallon cask o&rsquo; &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; beer outside in the
trap, and a ham, and half a rawmil&rsquo; cheese; for I thought you
might be short o&rsquo; forage in a lonely place like this; and it struck
me we might like to ask in a neighbour or two.&nbsp; But perhaps it
would be taking a liberty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, not at all,&rsquo; said Mr. Paddock, who was now in
the room, in a judicial measured manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very thoughtful
of &rsquo;ee, only &rsquo;twas not necessary, for we had just laid in
an extry stock of eatables and drinkables in preparation for the coming
event.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas very kind, upon my heart,&rsquo; said the soldier,
&lsquo;to think me worth such a jocund preparation, since you could
only have got my letter this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Selina gazed at her father to stop him, and exchanged embarrassed
glances with Miller.&nbsp; Contrary to her hopes Sergeant-Major Clark
plainly did not know that the preparations referred to were for something
quite other than his own visit.</p>
<p>The movement of the horse outside, and the impatient tapping of a
whip-handle upon the vehicle reminded them that Clark&rsquo;s driver
was still in waiting.&nbsp; The provisions were brought into the house,
and the cart dismissed.&nbsp; Miller, with very little pressure indeed,
accepted an invitation to supper, and a few neighbours were induced
to come in to make up a cheerful party.</p>
<p>During the laying of the meal, and throughout its continuance, Selina,
who sat beside her first intended husband, tried frequently to break
the news to him of her engagement to the other&mdash;now terminated
so suddenly, and so happily for her heart, and her sense of womanly
virtue.&nbsp; But the talk ran entirely upon the late war; and though
fortified by half a horn of the strong ale brought by the sergeant-major
she decided that she might have a better opportunity when supper was
over of revealing the situation to him in private.</p>
<p>Having supped, Clark leaned back at ease in his chair and looked
around.&nbsp; &lsquo;We used sometimes to have a dance in that other
room after supper, Selina dear, I recollect.&nbsp; We used to clear
out all the furniture into this room before beginning.&nbsp; Have you
kept up such goings on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not at all!&rsquo; said his sweetheart, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were not unlikely to revive it in a few days,&rsquo; said
Mr. Paddock.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, howsomever, there&rsquo;s seemingly many
a slip, as the saying is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell John all about that by and by!&rsquo;
interposed Selina; at which, perceiving that the secret which he did
not like keeping was to be kept even yet, her father held his tongue
with some show of testiness.</p>
<p>The subject of a dance having been broached, to put the thought in
practice was the feeling of all.&nbsp; Soon after the tables and chairs
were borne from the opposite room to this by zealous hands, and two
of the villagers sent home for a fiddle and tambourine, when the majority
began to tread a measure well known in that secluded vale.&nbsp; Selina
naturally danced with the sergeant-major, not altogether to her father&rsquo;s
satisfaction, and to the real uneasiness of her mother, both of whom
would have preferred a postponement of festivities till the rashly anticipated
relationship between their daughter and Clark in the past had been made
fact by the church&rsquo;s ordinances.&nbsp; They did not, however,
express a positive objection, Mr. Paddock remembering, with self-reproach,
that it was owing to his original strongly expressed disapproval of
Selina&rsquo;s being a soldier&rsquo;s wife that the wedding had been
delayed, and finally hindered&mdash;with worse consequences than were
expected; and ever since the misadventure brought about by his government
he had allowed events to steer their own courses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My tails will surely catch in your spurs, John!&rsquo; murmured
the daughter of the house, as she whirled around upon his arm with the
rapt soul and look of a somnambulist.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
we should dance, or I would have put on my other frock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care, my love.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve danced here
before.&nbsp; Do you think your father objects to me now?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
risen in rank.&nbsp; I fancy he&rsquo;s still a little against me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has repented, times enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so have I!&nbsp; If I had married you then &rsquo;twould
have saved many a misfortune.&nbsp; I have sometimes thought it might
have been possible to rush the ceremony through somehow before I left;
though we were only in the second asking, were we?&nbsp; And even if
I had come back straight here when we returned from the Crimea, and
married you then, how much happier I should have been!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear John, to say that!&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;dilatoriness and want of thought, and a fear of facing
your father after so long.&nbsp; I was in hospital a great while, you
know.&nbsp; But how familiar the place seems again!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that I saw on the beaufet in the other room?&nbsp; It never used to
be there.&nbsp; A sort of withered corpse of a cake&mdash;not an old
bride-cake surely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, John, ours.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the very one that was made
for our wedding three years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sakes alive!&nbsp; Why, time shuts up together, and all between
then and now seems not to have been!&nbsp; What became of that wedding-gown
that they were making in this room, I remember&mdash;a bluish, whitish,
frothy thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have that too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really! . . . Why, Selina&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not put it on now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem&mdash;.&nbsp; And yet, O how I should
like to!&nbsp; It would remind them all, if we told them what it was,
how we really meant to be married on that bygone day!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her
eyes were again laden with wet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . The pity that we didn&rsquo;t&mdash;the pity!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Moody mournfulness seemed to hold silent awhile one not naturally taciturn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well&mdash;will you?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will&mdash;the next dance, if mother don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, just before the next figure was formed, Selina disappeared,
and speedily came downstairs in a creased and box-worn, but still airy
and pretty, muslin gown, which was indeed the very one that had been
meant to grace her as a bride three years before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is dreadfully old-fashioned,&rsquo; she apologized.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; What a grand thought of mine!&nbsp; Now,
let&rsquo;s to&rsquo;t again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She explained to some of them, as he led her to the second dance,
what the frock had been meant for, and that she had put it on at his
request.&nbsp; And again athwart and around the room they went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem the bride!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t wear this gown to be married in now!&rsquo;
she replied, ecstatically, &lsquo;or I shouldn&rsquo;t have put it on
and made it dusty.&nbsp; It is really too old-fashioned, and so folded
and fretted out, you can&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; That was with my taking
it out so many times to look at.&nbsp; I have never put it on&mdash;never&mdash;till
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Selina, I am thinking of giving up the army.&nbsp; Will you
emigrate with me to New Zealand?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve an uncle out there
doing well, and he&rsquo;d soon help me to making a larger income.&nbsp;
The English army is glorious, but it ain&rsquo;t altogether enriching.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, anywhere that you decide upon.&nbsp; Is it healthy
there for Johnny?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lovely climate.&nbsp; And I shall never be happy in England
. . . Aha!&rsquo; he concluded again, with a bitterness of unexpected
strength, &lsquo;would to Heaven I had come straight back here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the dance brought round one neighbour after another the re-united
pair were thrown into juxtaposition with Bob Heartall among the rest
who had been called in; one whose chronic expression was that he carried
inside him a joke on the point of bursting with its own vastness.&nbsp;
He took occasion now to let out a little of its quality, shaking his
head at Selina as he addressed her in an undertone&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a bit of a topper to the bridegroom, ho ho!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill teach en the liberty you&rsquo;ll expect when you&rsquo;ve
married en!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he mean by a &ldquo;topper,&rdquo;&rsquo; the sergeant-major
asked, who, not being of local extraction, despised the venerable local
language, and also seemed to suppose &lsquo;bridegroom&rsquo; to be
an anticipatory name for himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only hope I shall never
be worse treated than you&rsquo;ve treated me to-night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Selina looked frightened.&nbsp; &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean you,
dear,&rsquo; she said as they moved on.&nbsp; &lsquo;We thought perhaps
you knew what had happened, owing to your coming just at this time.&nbsp;
Had you&mdash;heard anything about&mdash;what I intended?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a breath&mdash;how should I&mdash;away up in Yorkshire?&nbsp;
It was by the merest accident that I came just at this date to make
peace with you for my delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was engaged to be married to Mr. Bartholomew Miller.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what it is!&nbsp; I would have let &rsquo;ee know by letter,
but there was no time, only hearing from &rsquo;ee this afternoon .
. . You won&rsquo;t desert me for it, will you, John?&nbsp; Because,
as you know, I quite supposed you dead, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Her eyes were full of tears of trepidation, and he might have felt a
sob heaving within her.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>The soldier was silent during two or three double bars of the tune.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When were you to have been married to the said Mr. Bartholomew
Miller?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How soon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next week&mdash;O yes&mdash;just the same as it was with you
and me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a strange fate of interruption hanging over
me, I sometimes think!&nbsp; He had bought the licence, which I preferred
so that it mightn&rsquo;t be like&mdash;ours.&nbsp; But it made no difference
to the fate of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had bought the licence!&nbsp; The devil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, dear John.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m not angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was so kind of him, considering!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . I see, of course, how natural your action was&mdash;never
thinking of seeing me any more!&nbsp; Is it the Mr. Miller who is in
this dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Clark glanced round upon Bartholomew and was silent again, for some
little while, and she stole a look at him, to find that he seemed changed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;John, you look ill!&rsquo; she almost sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
me, is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O dear, no.&nbsp; Though I hadn&rsquo;t, somehow, expected
it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find fault with you for a moment&mdash;and I
don&rsquo;t . . . This is a deuce of a long dance, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been at it twenty minutes if a second, and the figure doesn&rsquo;t
allow one much rest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite out of breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They like them so dreadfully long here.&nbsp; Shall we drop
out?&nbsp; Or I&rsquo;ll stop the fiddler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no, I think I can finish.&nbsp; But although I look
healthy enough I have never been so strong as I formerly was, since
that long illness I had in the hospital at Scutari.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I knew nothing about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t, dear, as I didn&rsquo;t write.&nbsp; What
a fool I have been altogether!&rsquo;&nbsp; He gave a twitch, as of
one in pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t dance again when this one is
over.&nbsp; The fact is I have travelled a long way to-day, and it seems
to have knocked me up a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that the sergeant-major was unwell, and Selina
made herself miserable by still believing that her story was the cause
of his ailment.&nbsp; Suddenly he said in a changed voice, and she perceived
that he was paler than ever: &lsquo;I must sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Letting go her waist he went quickly to the other room.&nbsp; She
followed, and found him in the nearest chair, his face bent down upon
his hands and arms, which were resting on the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said her father, who sat there
dozing by the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John isn&rsquo;t well . . . We are going to New Zealand when
we are married, father.&nbsp; A lovely country!&nbsp; John, would you
like something to drink?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A drop o&rsquo; that Schiedam of old Owlett&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s
under stairs, perhaps,&rsquo; suggested her father.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not
that nowadays &rsquo;tis much better than licensed liquor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John,&rsquo; she said, putting her face close to his and pressing
his arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you have a drop of spirits or something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not reply, and Selina observed that his ear and the side of
his face were quite white.&nbsp; Convinced that his illness was serious,
a growing dismay seized hold of her.&nbsp; The dance ended; her mother
came in, and learning what had happened, looked narrowly at the sergeant-major.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must not let him lie like that, lift him up,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let him rest in the window-bench on some cushions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They unfolded his arms and hands as they lay clasped upon the table,
and on lifting his head found his features to bear the very impress
of death itself.&nbsp; Bartholomew Miller, who had now come in, assisted
Mr. Paddock to make a comfortable couch in the window-seat, where they
stretched out Clark upon his back.</p>
<p>Still he seemed unconscious.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must get a doctor,&rsquo;
said Selina.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, my dear John, how is it you be taken like
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My impression is that he&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; murmured Mr.
Paddock.&nbsp; &lsquo;He don&rsquo;t breathe enough to move a tomtit&rsquo;s
feather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were plenty to volunteer to go for a doctor, but as it would
be at least an hour before he could get there the case seemed somewhat
hopeless.&nbsp; The dancing-party ended as unceremoniously as it had
begun; but the guests lingered round the premises till the doctor should
arrive.&nbsp; When he did come the sergeant-major&rsquo;s extremities
were already cold, and there was no doubt that death had overtaken him
almost at the moment that he had sat down.</p>
<p>The medical practitioner quite refused to accept the unhappy Selina&rsquo;s
theory that her revelation had in any way induced Clark&rsquo;s sudden
collapse.&nbsp; Both he and the coroner afterwards, who found the immediate
cause to be heart-failure, held that such a supposition was unwarranted
by facts.&nbsp; They asserted that a long day&rsquo;s journey, a hurried
drive, and then an exhausting dance, were sufficient for such a result
upon a heart enfeebled by fatty degeneration after the privations of
a Crimean winter and other trying experiences, the coincidence of the
sad event with any disclosure of hers being a pure accident.</p>
<p>This conclusion, however, did not dislodge Selina&rsquo;s opinion
that the shock of her statement had been the immediate stroke which
had felled a constitution so undermined.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>At this date the Casterbridge Barracks were cavalry quarters, their
adaptation to artillery having been effected some years later.&nbsp;
It had been owing to the fact that the ---th Dragoons, in which John
Clark had served, happened to be lying there that Selina made his acquaintance.&nbsp;
At the time of his death the barracks were occupied by the Scots Greys,
but when the pathetic circumstances of the sergeant-major&rsquo;s end
became known in the town the officers of the Greys offered the services
of their fine reed and brass band, that he might have a funeral marked
by due military honours.&nbsp; His body was accordingly removed to the
barracks, and carried thence to the churchyard in the Durnover quarter
on the following afternoon, one of the Greys&rsquo; most ancient and
docile chargers being blacked up to represent Clark&rsquo;s horse on
the occasion.</p>
<p>Everybody pitied Selina, whose story was well known.&nbsp; She followed
the corpse as the only mourner, Clark having been without relations
in this part of the country, and a communication with his regiment having
brought none from a distance.&nbsp; She sat in a little shabby brown-black
mourning carriage, squeezing herself up in a corner to be as much as
possible out of sight during the slow and dramatic march through the
town to the tune from <i>Saul</i>.&nbsp; When the interment had taken
place, the volleys been fired, and the return journey begun, it was
with something like a shock that she found the military escort to be
moving at a quick march to the lively strains of &lsquo;Off she goes!&rsquo;
as if all care for the sergeant-major was expected to be ended with
the late discharge of the carbines.&nbsp; It was, by chance, the very
tune to which they had been footing when he died, and unable to bear
its notes, she hastily told her driver to drop behind.&nbsp; The band
and military party diminished up the High Street, and Selina turned
over Swan bridge and homeward to Mellstock.</p>
<p>Then recommenced for her a life whose incidents were precisely of
a suit with those which had preceded the soldier&rsquo;s return; but
how different in her appreciation of them!&nbsp; Her narrow miss of
the recovered respectability they had hoped for from that tardy event
worked upon her parents as an irritant, and after the first week or
two of her mourning her life with them grew almost insupportable.&nbsp;
She had impulsively taken to herself the weeds of a widow, for such
she seemed to herself to be, and clothed little Johnny in sables likewise.&nbsp;
This assumption of a moral relationship to the deceased, which she asserted
to be only not a legal one by two most unexpected accidents, led the
old people to indulge in sarcasm at her expense whenever they beheld
her attire, though all the while it cost them more pain to utter than
it gave her to hear it.&nbsp; Having become accustomed by her residence
at home to the business carried on by her father, she surprised them
one day by going off with the child to Chalk-Newton, in the direction
of the town of Ivell, and opening a miniature fruit and vegetable shop,
attending Ivell market with her produce.&nbsp; Her business grew somewhat
larger, and it was soon sufficient to enable her to support herself
and the boy in comfort.&nbsp; She called herself &lsquo;Mrs. John Clark&rsquo;
from the day of leaving home, and painted the name on her signboard&mdash;no
man forbidding her.</p>
<p>By degrees the pain of her state was forgotten in her new circumstances,
and getting to be generally accepted as the widow of a sergeant-major
of dragoons&mdash;an assumption which her modest and mournful demeanour
seemed to substantiate&mdash;her life became a placid one, her mind
being nourished by the melancholy luxury of dreaming what might have
been her future in New Zealand with John, if he had only lived to take
her there.&nbsp; Her only travels now were a journey to Ivell on market-days,
and once a fortnight to the churchyard in which Clark lay, there to
tend, with Johnny&rsquo;s assistance, as widows are wont to do, the
flowers she had planted upon his grave.</p>
<p>On a day about eighteen months after his unexpected decease, Selina
was surprised in her lodging over her little shop by a visit from Bartholomew
Miller.&nbsp; He had called on her once or twice before, on which occasions
he had used without a word of comment the name by which she was known.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come this time,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;less because
I was in this direction than to ask you, Mrs. Clark, what you mid well
guess.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come o&rsquo; purpose, in short.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis to ask me again to marry you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course.&nbsp; You see, his coming back for &rsquo;ee
proved what I always believed of &rsquo;ee, though others didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nobody but would be glad to welcome you to our parish
again, now you&rsquo;ve showed your independence and acted up to your
trust in his promise.&nbsp; Well, my dear, will you come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather bide as Mrs. Clark, I think,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am not ashamed of my position at all; for I am John&rsquo;s
widow in the eyes of Heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I quite agree&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp;
Still, you won&rsquo;t like to be always straining at this shop-keeping
and market-standing; and &rsquo;twould be better for Johnny if you had
nothing to do but tend him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He here touched the only weak spot in Selina&rsquo;s resistance to
his proposal&mdash;the good of the boy.&nbsp; To promote that there
were other men she might have married offhand without loving them if
they had asked her to; but though she had known the worthy speaker from
her youth, she could not for the moment fancy herself happy as Mrs.
Miller.</p>
<p>He paused awhile.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to tell &rsquo;ee, Mrs. Clark,&rsquo;
he said by and by, &lsquo;that marrying is getting to be a pressing
question with me.&nbsp; Not on my own account at all.&nbsp; The truth
is, that mother is growing old, and I am away from home a good deal,
so that it is almost necessary there should be another person in the
house with her besides me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the practical consideration
which forces me to think of taking a wife, apart from my wish to take
you; and you know there&rsquo;s nobody in the world I care for so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said something about there being far better women than she, and
other natural commonplaces; but assured him she was most grateful to
him for feeling what he felt, as indeed she sincerely was.&nbsp; However,
Selina would not consent to be the useful third person in his comfortable
home&mdash;at any rate just then.&nbsp; He went away, after taking tea
with her, without discerning much hope for him in her good-bye.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>After that evening she saw and heard nothing of him for a great while.&nbsp;
Her fortnightly journeys to the sergeant-major&rsquo;s grave were continued,
whenever weather did not hinder them; and Mr. Miller must have known,
she thought, of this custom of hers.&nbsp; But though the churchyard
was not nearly so far from his homestead as was her shop at Chalk-Newton,
he never appeared in the accidental way that lovers use.</p>
<p>An explanation was forthcoming in the shape of a letter from her
mother, who casually mentioned that Mr. Bartholomew Miller had gone
away to the other side of Shottsford-Forum to be married to a thriving
dairyman&rsquo;s daughter that he knew there.&nbsp; His chief motive,
it was reported, had been less one of love than a wish to provide a
companion for his aged mother.</p>
<p>Selina was practical enough to know that she had lost a good and
possibly the only opportunity of settling in life after what had happened,
and for a moment she regretted her independence.&nbsp; But she became
calm on reflection, and to fortify herself in her course started that
afternoon to tend the sergeant-major&rsquo;s grave, in which she took
the same sober pleasure as at first.</p>
<p>On reaching the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot
as usual, she was surprised to perceive another woman, also apparently
a respectable widow, and with a tiny boy by her side, bending over Clark&rsquo;s
turf, and spudding up with the point of her umbrella some ivy-roots
that Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle
over the mound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you digging up my ivy for!&rsquo; cried Selina, rushing
forward so excitedly that Johnny tumbled over a grave with the force
of the tug she gave his hand in her sudden start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your ivy?&rsquo; said the respectable woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why yes!&nbsp; I planted it there&mdash;on my husband&rsquo;s
grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Your</i> husband&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; The late Sergeant-Major Clark.&nbsp; Anyhow, as
good as my husband, for he was just going to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&nbsp; But who may be my husband, if not he?&nbsp;
I am the only Mrs. John Clark, widow of the late Sergeant-Major of Dragoons,
and this is his only son and heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can that be?&rsquo; faltered Selina, her throat seeming
to stick together as she just began to perceive its possibility.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He had been&mdash;going to marry me twice&mdash;and we were going
to New Zealand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&mdash;I remember about you,&rsquo; returned the legitimate
widow calmly and not unkindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must be Selina; he spoke
of you now and then, and said that his relations with you would always
be a weight on his conscience.&nbsp; Well; the history of my life with
him is soon told.&nbsp; When he came back from the Crimea he became
acquainted with me at my home in the north, and we were married within
a month of first knowing each other.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after living
together a few months, we could not agree; and after a particularly
sharp quarrel, in which, perhaps, I was most in the wrong&mdash;as I
don&rsquo;t mind owning here by his graveside&mdash;he went away from
me, declaring he would buy his discharge and emigrate to New Zealand,
and never come back to me any more.&nbsp; The next thing I heard was
that he had died suddenly at Mellstock at some low carouse; and as he
had left me in such anger to live no more with me, I wouldn&rsquo;t
come down to his funeral, or do anything in relation to him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
temper, I know, but that was the fact.&nbsp; Even if we had parted friends
it would have been a serious expense to travel three hundred miles to
get there, for one who wasn&rsquo;t left so very well off . . . I am
sorry I pulled up your ivy-roots; but that common sort of ivy is considered
a weed in my part of the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>December</i> 1899.</p>
<h2>A TRYST AT AN ANCIENT EARTH WORK</h2>
<p>At one&rsquo;s every step forward it rises higher against the south
sky, with an obtrusive personality that compels the senses to regard
it and consider.&nbsp; The eyes may bend in another direction, but never
without the consciousness of its heavy, high-shouldered presence at
its point of vantage.&nbsp; Across the intervening levels the gale races
in a straight line from the fort, as if breathed out of it hitherward.&nbsp;
With the shifting of the clouds the faces of the steeps vary in colour
and in shade, broad lights appearing where mist and vagueness had prevailed,
dissolving in their turn into melancholy gray, which spreads over and
eclipses the luminous bluffs.&nbsp; In this so-thought immutable spectacle
all is change.</p>
<p>Out of the invisible marine region on the other side birds soar suddenly
into the air, and hang over the summits of the heights with the indifference
of long familiarity.&nbsp; Their forms are white against the tawny concave
of cloud, and the curves they exhibit in their floating signify that
they are sea-gulls which have journeyed inland from expected stress
of weather.&nbsp; As the birds rise behind the fort, so do the clouds
rise behind the birds, almost as it seems, stroking with their bagging
bosoms the uppermost flyers.</p>
<p>The profile of the whole stupendous ruin, as seen at a distance of
a mile eastward, is cleanly cut as that of a marble inlay.&nbsp; It
is varied with protuberances, which from hereabouts have the animal
aspect of warts, wens, knuckles, and hips.&nbsp; It may indeed be likened
to an enormous many-limbed organism of an antediluvian time&mdash;partaking
of the cephalopod in shape&mdash;lying lifeless, and covered with a
thin green cloth, which hides its substance, while revealing its contour.&nbsp;
This dull green mantle of herbage stretches down towards the levels,
where the ploughs have essayed for centuries to creep up near and yet
nearer to the base of the castle, but have always stopped short before
reaching it.&nbsp; The furrows of these environing attempts show themselves
distinctly, bending to the incline as they trench upon it; mounting
in steeper curves, till the steepness baffles them, and their parallel
threads show like the striae of waves pausing on the curl.&nbsp; The
peculiar place of which these are some of the features is &lsquo;Mai-Dun,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Castle of the Great Hill,&rsquo; said to be the Dunium of
Ptolemy, the capital of the Durotriges, which eventually came into Roman
occupation, and was finally deserted on their withdrawal from the island.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The evening is followed by a night on which an invisible moon bestows
a subdued, yet pervasive light&mdash;without radiance, as without blackness.&nbsp;
From the spot whereon I am ensconced in a cottage, a mile away, the
fort has now ceased to be visible; yet, as by day, to anybody whose
thoughts have been engaged with it and its barbarous grandeurs of past
time the form asserts its existence behind the night gauzes as persistently
as if it had a voice.&nbsp; Moreover, the south-west wind continues
to feed the intervening arable flats with vapours brought directly from
its sides.</p>
<p>The midnight hour for which there has been occasion to wait at length
arrives, and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request
urged earlier in the day.&nbsp; It concerns an appointment, which I
rather regret my decision to keep now that night is come.&nbsp; The
route thither is hedgeless and treeless&mdash;I need not add deserted.&nbsp;
The moonlight is sufficient to disclose the pale riband-like surface
of the way as it trails along between the expanses of darker fallow.&nbsp;
Though the road passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly
to its fronts.&nbsp; As the place is without an inhabitant, so it is
without a trackway.&nbsp; So presently leaving the macadamized road
to pursue its course elsewhither, I step off upon the fallow, and plod
stumblingly across it.&nbsp; The castle looms out off the shade by degrees,
like a thing waking up and asking what I want there.&nbsp; It is now
so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape cannot be taken in at one
view.&nbsp; The ploughed ground ends as the rise sharpens, the sloping
basement of grass begins, and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun.</p>
<p>Impressive by day as this largest Ancient-British work in the kingdom
undoubtedly is, its impressiveness is increased now.&nbsp; After standing
still and spending a few minutes in adding its age to its size, and
its size to its solitude, it becomes appallingly mournful in its growing
closeness.&nbsp; A squally wind blows in the face with an impact which
proclaims that the vapours of the air sail low to-night.&nbsp; The slope
that I so laboriously clamber up the wind skips sportively down.&nbsp;
Its track can be discerned even in this light by the undulations of
the withered grass-bents&mdash;the only produce of this upland summit
except moss.&nbsp; Four minutes of ascent, and a vantage-ground of some
sort is gained.&nbsp; It is only the crest of the outer rampart.&nbsp;
Immediately within this a chasm gapes; its bottom is imperceptible,
but the counterscarp slopes not too steeply to admit of a sliding descent
if cautiously performed.&nbsp; The shady bottom, dank and chilly, is
thus gained, and reveals itself as a kind of winding lane, wide enough
for a waggon to pass along, floored with rank herbage, and trending
away, right and left, into obscurity, between the concentric walls of
earth.&nbsp; The towering closeness of these on each hand, their impenetrability,
and their ponderousness, are felt as a physical pressure.&nbsp; The
way is now up the second of them, which stands steeper and higher than
the first.&nbsp; To turn aside, as did Christian&rsquo;s companion,
from such a Hill Difficulty, is the more natural tendency; but the way
to the interior is upward.&nbsp; There is, of course, an entrance to
the fortress; but that lies far off on the other side.&nbsp; It might
possibly have been the wiser course to seek for easier ingress there.</p>
<p>However, being here, I ascend the second acclivity.&nbsp; The grass
stems&mdash;the grey beard of the hill&mdash;sway in a mass close to
my stooping face.&nbsp; The dead heads of these various grasses&mdash;fescues,
fox-tails, and ryes&mdash;bob and twitch as if pulled by a string underground.&nbsp;
From a few thistles a whistling proceeds; and even the moss speaks,
in its humble way, under the stress of the blast.</p>
<p>That the summit of the second line of defence has been gained is
suddenly made known by a contrasting wind from a new quarter, coming
over with the curve of a cascade.&nbsp; These novel gusts raise a sound
from the whole camp or castle, playing upon it bodily as upon a harp.&nbsp;
It is with some difficulty that a foothold can be preserved under their
sweep.&nbsp; Looking aloft for a moment I perceive that the sky is much
more overcast than it has been hitherto, and in a few instants a dead
lull in what is now a gale ensues with almost preternatural abruptness.&nbsp;
I take advantage of this to sidle down the second counterscarp, but
by the time the ditch is reached the lull reveals itself to be but the
precursor of a storm.&nbsp; It begins with a heave of the whole atmosphere,
like the sigh of a weary strong man on turning to re-commence unusual
exertion, just as I stand here in the second fosse.&nbsp; That which
now radiates from the sky upon the scene is not so much light as vaporous
phosphorescence.</p>
<p>The wind, quickening, abandons the natural direction it has pursued
on the open upland, and takes the course of the gorge&rsquo;s length,
rushing along therein helter-skelter, and carrying thick rain upon its
back.&nbsp; The rain is followed by hailstones which fly through the
defile in battalions&mdash;rolling, hopping, ricochetting, snapping,
clattering down the shelving banks in an undefinable haze of confusion.&nbsp;
The earthen sides of the fosse seem to quiver under the drenching onset,
though it is practically no more to them than the blows of Thor upon
the giant of Jotun-land.&nbsp; It is impossible to proceed further till
the storm somewhat abates, and I draw up behind a spur of the inner
scarp, where possibly a barricade stood two thousand years ago; and
thus await events.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The roar of the storm can be heard travelling the complete circuit
of the castle&mdash;a measured mile&mdash;coming round at intervals
like a circumambulating column of infantry.&nbsp; Doubtless such a column
has passed this way in its time, but the only columns which enter in
these latter days are the columns of sheep and oxen that are sometimes
seen here now; while the only semblance of heroic voices heard are the
utterances of such, and of the many winds which make their passage through
the ravines.</p>
<p>The expected lightning radiates round, and a rumbling as from its
subterranean vaults&mdash;if there are any&mdash;fills the castle.&nbsp;
The lightning repeats itself, and, coming after the aforesaid thoughts
of martial men, it bears a fanciful resemblance to swords moving in
combat.&nbsp; It has the very brassy hue of the ancient weapons that
here were used.&nbsp; The so sudden entry upon the scene of this metallic
flame is as the entry of a presiding exhibitor who unrolls the maps,
uncurtains the pictures, unlocks the cabinets, and effects a transformation
by merely exposing the materials of his science, unintelligibly cloaked
till then.&nbsp; The abrupt configuration of the bluffs and mounds is
now for the first time clearly revealed&mdash;mounds whereon, doubtless,
spears and shields have frequently lain while their owners loosened
their sandals and yawned and stretched their arms in the sun.&nbsp;
For the first time, too, a glimpse is obtainable of the true entrance
used by its occupants of old, some way ahead.</p>
<p>There, where all passage has seemed to be inviolably barred by an
almost vertical fa&ccedil;ade, the ramparts are found to overlap each
other like loosely clasped fingers, between which a zigzag path may
be followed&mdash;a cunning construction that puzzles the uninformed
eye.&nbsp; But its cunning, even where not obscured by dilapidation,
is now wasted on the solitary forms of a few wild badgers, rabbits,
and hares.&nbsp; Men must have often gone out by those gates in the
morning to battle with the Roman legions under Vespasian; some to return
no more, others to come back at evening, bringing with them the noise
of their heroic deeds.&nbsp; But not a page, not a stone, has preserved
their fame.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Acoustic perceptions multiply to-night.&nbsp; We can almost hear
the stream of years that have borne those deeds away from us.&nbsp;
Strange articulations seem to float on the air from that point, the
gateway, where the animation in past times must frequently have concentrated
itself at hours of coming and going, and general excitement.&nbsp; There
arises an ineradicable fancy that they are human voices; if so, they
must be the lingering air-borne vibrations of conversations uttered
at least fifteen hundred years ago.&nbsp; The attention is attracted
from mere nebulous imaginings about yonder spot by a real moving of
something close at hand.</p>
<p>I recognize by the now moderate flashes of lightning, which are sheet-like
and nearly continuous, that it is the gradual elevation of a small mound
of earth.&nbsp; At first no larger than a man&rsquo;s fist it reaches
the dimensions of a hat, then sinks a little and is still.&nbsp; It
is but the heaving of a mole who chooses such weather as this to work
in from some instinct that there will be nobody abroad to molest him.&nbsp;
As the fine earth lifts and lifts and falls loosely aside fragments
of burnt clay roll out of it&mdash;clay that once formed part of cups
or other vessels used by the inhabitants of the fortress.</p>
<p>The violence of the storm has been counterbalanced by its transitoriness.&nbsp;
From being immersed in well-nigh solid media of cloud and hail shot
with lightning, I find myself uncovered of the humid investiture and
left bare to the mild gaze of the moon, which sparkles now on every
wet grass-blade and frond of moss.</p>
<p>But I am not yet inside the fort, and the delayed ascent of the third
and last escarpment is now made.&nbsp; It is steeper than either.&nbsp;
The first was a surface to walk up, the second to stagger up, the third
can only be ascended on the hands and toes.&nbsp; On the summit obtrudes
the first evidence which has been met with in these precincts that the
time is really the nineteenth century; it is in the form of a white
notice-board on a post, and the wording can just be discerned by the
rays of the setting moon:</p>
<p>CAUTION.&mdash;Any Person found removing Relics, Skeletons, Stones,
Pottery, Tiles, or other Material from this Earthwork, or cutting up
the Ground, will be Prosecuted as the Law directs.</p>
<p>Here one observes a difference underfoot from what has gone before:
scraps of Roman tile and stone chippings protrude through the grass
in meagre quantity, but sufficient to suggest that masonry stood on
the spot.&nbsp; Before the eye stretches under the moonlight the interior
of the fort.&nbsp; So open and so large is it as to be practically an
upland plateau, and yet its area lies wholly within the walls of what
may be designated as one building.&nbsp; It is a long-violated retreat;
all its corner-stones, plinths, and architraves were carried away to
build neighbouring villages even before mediaeval or modern history
began.&nbsp; Many a block which once may have helped to form a bastion
here rests now in broken and diminished shape as part of the chimney-corner
of some shepherd&rsquo;s cottage within the distant horizon, and the
corner-stones of this heathen altar may form the base-course of some
adjoining village church.</p>
<p>Yet the very bareness of these inner courts and wards, their condition
of mere pasturage, protects what remains of them as no defences could
do.&nbsp; Nothing is left visible that the hands can seize on or the
weather overturn, and a permanence of general outline at least results,
which no other condition could ensure.</p>
<p>The position of the castle on this isolated hill bespeaks deliberate
and strategic choice exercised by some remote mind capable of prospective
reasoning to a far extent.&nbsp; The natural configuration of the surrounding
country and its bearing upon such a stronghold were obviously long considered
and viewed mentally before its extensive design was carried into execution.&nbsp;
Who was the man that said, &lsquo;Let it be built here!&rsquo;&mdash;not
on that hill yonder, or on that ridge behind, but on this best spot
of all?&nbsp; Whether he were some great one of the Belgae, or of the
Durotriges, or the travelling engineer of Britain&rsquo;s united tribes,
must for ever remain time&rsquo;s secret; his form cannot be realized,
nor his countenance, nor the tongue that he spoke, when he set down
his foot with a thud and said, &lsquo;Let it be here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Within the innermost enclosure, though it is so wide that at a superficial
glance the beholder has only a sense of standing on a breezy down, the
solitude is rendered yet more solitary by the knowledge that between
the benighted sojourner herein and all kindred humanity are those three
concentric walls of earth which no being would think of scaling on such
a night as this, even were he to hear the most pathetic cries issuing
hence that could be uttered by a spectre-chased soul.&nbsp; I reach
a central mound or platform&mdash;the crown and axis of the whole structure.&nbsp;
The view from here by day must be of almost limitless extent.&nbsp;
On this raised floor, dais, or rostrum, harps have probably twanged
more or less tuneful notes in celebration of daring, strength, or cruelty;
of worship, superstition, love, birth, and death; of simple loving-kindness
perhaps never.&nbsp; Many a time must the king or leader have directed
his keen eyes hence across the open lands towards the ancient road,
the Icening Way, still visible in the distance, on the watch for armed
companies approaching either to succour or to attack.</p>
<p>I am startled by a voice pronouncing my name.&nbsp; Past and present
have become so confusedly mingled under the associations of the spot
that for a time it has escaped my memory that this mound was the place
agreed on for the aforesaid appointment.&nbsp; I turn and behold my
friend.&nbsp; He stands with a dark lantern in his hand and a spade
and light pickaxe over his shoulder.&nbsp; He expresses both delight
and surprise that I have come.&nbsp; I tell him I had set out before
the bad weather began.</p>
<p>He, to whom neither weather, darkness, nor difficulty seems to have
any relation or significance, so entirely is his soul wrapped up in
his own deep intentions, asks me to take the lantern and accompany him.&nbsp;
I take it and walk by his side.&nbsp; He is a man about sixty, small
in figure, with grey old-fashioned whiskers cut to the shape of a pair
of crumb-brushes.&nbsp; He is entirely in black broadcloth&mdash;or
rather, at present, black and brown, for he is bespattered with mud
from his heels to the crown of his low hat.&nbsp; He has no consciousness
of this&mdash;no sense of anything but his purpose, his ardour for which
causes his eyes to shine like those of a lynx, and gives his motions,
all the elasticity of an athlete&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody to interrupt us at this time of night!&rsquo; he chuckles
with fierce enjoyment.</p>
<p>We retreat a little way and find a sort of angle, an elevation in
the sod, a suggested squareness amid the mass of irregularities around.&nbsp;
Here, he tells me, if anywhere, the king&rsquo;s house stood.&nbsp;
Three months of measurement and calculation have confirmed him in this
conclusion.</p>
<p>He requests me now to open the lantern, which I do, and the light
streams out upon the wet sod.&nbsp; At last divining his proceedings
I say that I had no idea, in keeping the tryst, that he was going to
do more at such an unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble
through the stronghold.&nbsp; I ask him why, having a practicable object,
he should have minded interruptions and not have chosen the day?&nbsp;
He informs me, quietly pointing to his spade, that it was because his
purpose is to dig, then signifying with a grim nod the gaunt notice-post
against the sky beyond.&nbsp; I inquire why, as a professed and well-known
antiquary with capital letters at the tail of his name, he did not obtain
the necessary authority, considering the stringent penalties for this
sort of thing; and he chuckles fiercely again with suppressed delight,
and says, &lsquo;Because they wouldn&rsquo;t have given it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He at once begins cutting up the sod, and, as he takes the pickaxe
to follow on with, assures me that, penalty or no penalty, honest men
or marauders, he is sure of one thing, that we shall not be disturbed
at our work till after dawn.</p>
<p>I remember to have heard of men who, in their enthusiasm for some
special science, art, or hobby, have quite lost the moral sense which
would restrain them from indulging it illegitimately; and I conjecture
that here, at last, is an instance of such an one.&nbsp; He probably
guesses the way my thoughts travel, for he stands up and solemnly asserts
that he has a distinctly justifiable intention in this matter; namely,
to uncover, to search, to verify a theory or displace it, and to cover
up again.&nbsp; He means to take away nothing&mdash;not a grain of sand.&nbsp;
In this he says he sees no such monstrous sin.&nbsp; I inquire if this
is really a promise to me?&nbsp; He repeats that it is a promise, and
resumes digging.&nbsp; My contribution to the labour is that of directing
the light constantly upon the hole.&nbsp; When he has reached something
more than a foot deep he digs more cautiously, saying that, be it much
or little there, it will not lie far below the surface; such things
never are deep.&nbsp; A few minutes later the point of the pickaxe clicks
upon a stony substance.&nbsp; He draws the implement out as feelingly
as if it had entered a man&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Taking up the spade he
shovels with care, and a surface, level as an altar, is presently disclosed.&nbsp;
His eyes flash anew; he pulls handfuls of grass and mops the surface
clean, finally rubbing it with his handkerchief.&nbsp; Grasping the
lantern from my hand he holds it close to the ground, when the rays
reveal a complete mosaic&mdash;a pavement of minute tesserae of many
colours, of intricate pattern, a work of much art, of much time, and
of much industry.&nbsp; He exclaims in a shout that he knew it always&mdash;that
it is not a Celtic stronghold exclusively, but also a Roman; the former
people having probably contributed little more than the original framework
which the latter took and adapted till it became the present imposing
structure.</p>
<p>I ask, What if it is Roman?</p>
<p>A great deal, according to him.&nbsp; That it proves all the world
to be wrong in this great argument, and himself alone to be right!&nbsp;
Can I wait while he digs further?</p>
<p>I agree&mdash;reluctantly; but he does not notice my reluctance.&nbsp;
At an adjoining spot he begins flourishing the tools anew with the skill
of a navvy, this venerable scholar with letters after his name.&nbsp;
Sometimes he falls on his knees, burrowing with his hands in the manner
of a hare, and where his old-fashioned broadcloth touches the sides
of the hole it gets plastered with the damp earth.&nbsp; He continually
murmurs to himself how important, how very important, this discovery
is!&nbsp; He draws out an object; we wash it in the same primitive way
by rubbing it with the wet grass, and it proves to be a semi-transparent
bottle of iridescent beauty, the sight of which draws groans of luxurious
sensibility from the digger.&nbsp; Further and further search brings
out a piece of a weapon.&nbsp; It is strange indeed that by merely peeling
off a wrapper of modern accumulations we have lowered ourselves into
an ancient world.&nbsp; Finally a skeleton is uncovered, fairly perfect.&nbsp;
He lays it out on the grass, bone to its bone.</p>
<p>My friend says the man must have fallen fighting here, as this is
no place of burial.&nbsp; He turns again to the trench, scrapes, feels,
till from a corner he draws out a heavy lump&mdash;a small image four
or five inches high. We clean it as before.&nbsp; It is a statuette,
apparently of gold, or, more probably, of bronze-gilt&mdash;a figure
of Mercury, obviously, its head being surmounted with the petasus or
winged hat, the usual accessory of that deity.&nbsp; Further inspection
reveals the workmanship to be of good finish and detail, and, preserved
by the limy earth, to be as fresh in every line as on the day it left
the hands of its artificer.</p>
<p>We seem to be standing in the Roman Forum and not on a hill in Wessex.&nbsp;
Intent upon this truly valuable relic of the old empire of which even
this remote spot was a component part, we do not notice what is going
on in the present world till reminded of it by the sudden renewal of
the storm.&nbsp; Looking up I perceive that the wide extinguisher of
cloud has again settled down upon the fortress-town, as if resting upon
the edge of the inner rampart, and shutting out the moon.&nbsp; I turn
my back to the tempest, still directing the light across the hole.&nbsp;
My companion digs on unconcernedly; he is living two thousand years
ago, and despises things of the moment as dreams.&nbsp; But at last
he is fairly beaten, and standing up beside me looks round on what he
has done.&nbsp; The rays of the lantern pass over the trench to the
tall skeleton stretched upon the grass on the other side.&nbsp; The
beating rain has washed the bones clean and smooth, and the forehead,
cheek-bones, and two-and-thirty teeth of the skull glisten in the candle-shine
as they lie.</p>
<p>This storm, like the first, is of the nature of a squall, and it
ends as abruptly as the other.&nbsp; We dig no further.&nbsp; My friend
says that it is enough&mdash;he has proved his point.&nbsp; He turns
to replace the bones in the trench and covers them.&nbsp; But they fall
to pieces under his touch: the air has disintegrated them, and he can
only sweep in the fragments.&nbsp; The next act of his plan is more
than difficult, but is carried out.&nbsp; The treasures are inhumed
again in their respective holes: they are not ours.&nbsp; Each deposition
seems to cost him a twinge; and at one moment I fancied I saw him slip
his hand into his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must re-bury them <i>all</i>,&rsquo; say I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; he answers with integrity.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
wiping my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The beauties of the tesselated floor of the governor&rsquo;s house
are once again consigned to darkness; the trench is filled up; the sod
laid smoothly down; he wipes the perspiration from his forehead with
the same handkerchief he had used to mop the skeleton and tesserae clean;
and we make for the eastern gate of the fortress.</p>
<p>Dawn bursts upon us suddenly as we reach the opening.&nbsp; It comes
by the lifting and thinning of the clouds that way till we are bathed
in a pink light.&nbsp; The direction of his homeward journey is not
the same as mine, and we part under the outer slope.</p>
<p>Walking along quickly to restore warmth I muse upon my eccentric
friend, and cannot help asking myself this question: Did he really replace
the gilded image of the god Mercurius with the rest of the treasures?&nbsp;
He seemed to do so; and yet I could not testify to the fact.&nbsp; Probably,
however, he was as good as his word.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was thus I spoke to myself, and so the adventure ended.&nbsp;
But one thing remains to be told, and that is concerned with seven years
after.&nbsp; Among the effects of my friend, at that time just deceased,
was found, carefully preserved, a gilt statuette representing Mercury,
labelled &lsquo;Debased Roman.&rsquo;&nbsp; No record was attached to
explain how it came into his possession.&nbsp; The figure was bequeathed
to the Casterbridge Museum.</p>
<p>Detroit Post,</p>
<p>March 1885.</p>
<h2>WHAT THE SHEPHERD SAW: A TALE OF FOUR MOONLIGHT NIGHTS</h2>
<p>The genial Justice of the Peace&mdash;now, alas, no more&mdash;who
made himself responsible for the facts of this story, used to begin
in the good old-fashioned way with a bright moonlight night and a mysterious
figure, an excellent stroke for an opening, even to this day, if well
followed up.</p>
<p>The Christmas moon (he would say) was showing her cold face to the
upland, the upland reflecting the radiance in frost-sparkles so minute
as only to be discernible by an eye near at hand.&nbsp; This eye, he
said, was the eye of a shepherd lad, young for his occupation, who stood
within a wheeled hut of the kind commonly in use among sheep-keepers
during the early lambing season, and was abstractedly looking through
the loophole at the scene without.</p>
<p>The spot was called Lambing Corner, and it was a sheltered portion
of that wide expanse of rough pastureland known as the Marlbury Downs,
which you directly traverse when following the turnpike-road across
Mid-Wessex from London, through Aldbrickham, in the direction of Bath
and Bristol.&nbsp; Here, where the hut stood, the land was high and
dry, open, except to the north, and commanding an undulating view for
miles.&nbsp; On the north side grew a tall belt of coarse furze, with
enormous stalks, a clump of the same standing detached in front of the
general mass.&nbsp; The clump was hollow, and the interior had been
ingeniously taken advantage of as a position for the before-mentioned
hut, which was thus completely screened from winds, and almost invisible,
except through the narrow approach.&nbsp; But the furze twigs had been
cut away from the two little windows of the hut, that the occupier might
keep his eye on his sheep.</p>
<p>In the rear, the shelter afforded by the belt of furze bushes was
artificially improved by an inclosure of upright stakes, interwoven
with boughs of the same prickly vegetation, and within the inclosure
lay a renowned Marlbury-Down breeding flock of eight hundred ewes.</p>
<p>To the south, in the direction of the young shepherd&rsquo;s idle
gaze, there rose one conspicuous object above the uniform moonlit plateau,
and only one.&nbsp; It was a Druidical trilithon, consisting of three
oblong stones in the form of a doorway, two on end, and one across as
a lintel.&nbsp; Each stone had been worn, scratched, washed, nibbled,
split, and otherwise attacked by ten thousand different weathers; but
now the blocks looked shapely and little the worse for wear, so beautifully
were they silvered over by the light of the moon.&nbsp; The ruin was
locally called the Devil&rsquo;s Door.</p>
<p>An old shepherd presently entered the hut from the direction of the
ewes, and looked around in the gloom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be ye sleepy?&rsquo;
he asked in cross accents of the boy.</p>
<p>The lad replied rather timidly in the negative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the shepherd, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get me home-along,
and rest for a few hours.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to be done here
now as I can see.&nbsp; The ewes can want no more tending till daybreak&mdash;&rsquo;tis
beyond the bounds of reason that they can.&nbsp; But as the order is
that one of us must bide, I&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;ee, d&rsquo;ye hear.&nbsp;
You can sleep by day, and I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And you can be down to
my house in ten minutes if anything should happen.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
afford &rsquo;ee candle; but, as &rsquo;tis Christmas week, and the
time that folks have hollerdays, you can enjoy yerself by falling asleep
a bit in the chair instead of biding awake all the time.&nbsp; But mind,
not longer at once than while the shade of the Devil&rsquo;s Door moves
a couple of spans, for you must keep an eye upon the ewes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy made no definite reply, and the old man, stirring the fire
in the stove with his crook-stem, closed the door upon his companion
and vanished.</p>
<p>As this had been more or less the course of events every night since
the season&rsquo;s lambing had set in, the boy was not at all surprised
at the charge, and amused himself for some time by lighting straws at
the stove.&nbsp; He then went out to the ewes and new-born lambs, re-entered,
sat down, and finally fell asleep.&nbsp; This was his customary manner
of performing his watch, for though special permission for naps had
this week been accorded, he had, as a matter of fact, done the same
thing on every preceding night, sleeping often till awakened by a smack
on the shoulder at three or four in the morning from the crook-stem
of the old man.</p>
<p>It might have been about eleven o&rsquo;clock when he awoke.&nbsp;
He was so surprised at awaking without, apparently, being called or
struck, that on second thoughts he assumed that somebody must have called
him in spite of appearances, and looked out of the hut window towards
the sheep.&nbsp; They all lay as quiet as when he had visited them,
very little bleating being audible, and no human soul disturbing the
scene.&nbsp; He next looked from the opposite window, and here the case
was different.&nbsp; The frost-facets glistened under the moon as before;
an occasional furze bush showed as a dark spot on the same; and in the
foreground stood the ghostly form of the trilithon.&nbsp; But in front
of the trilithon stood a man.</p>
<p>That he was not the shepherd or any one of the farm labourers was
apparent in a moment&rsquo;s observation,&mdash;his dress being a dark
suit, and his figure of slender build and graceful carriage.&nbsp; He
walked backwards and forwards in front of the trilithon.</p>
<p>The shepherd lad had hardly done speculating on the strangeness of
the unknown&rsquo;s presence here at such an hour, when he saw a second
figure crossing the open sward towards the locality of the trilithon
and furze-clump that screened the hut.&nbsp; This second personage was
a woman; and immediately on sight of her the male stranger hastened
forward, meeting her just in front of the hut window.&nbsp; Before she
seemed to be aware of his intention he clasped her in his arms.</p>
<p>The lady released herself and drew back with some dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have come, Harriet&mdash;bless you for it!&rsquo; he exclaimed,
fervently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not for this,&rsquo; she answered, in offended accents.&nbsp;
And then, more good-naturedly, &lsquo;I have come, Fred, because you
entreated me so!&nbsp; What can have been the object of your writing
such a letter?&nbsp; I feared I might be doing you grievous ill by staying
away.&nbsp; How did you come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I walked all the way from my father&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what is it?&nbsp; How have you lived since we last met?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But roughly; you might have known that without asking.&nbsp;
I have seen many lands and many faces since I last walked these downs,
but I have only thought of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it only to tell me this that you have summoned me so strangely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A passing breeze blew away the murmur of the reply and several succeeding
sentences, till the man&rsquo;s voice again became audible in the words,
&lsquo;Harriet&mdash;truth between us two!&nbsp; I have heard that the
Duke does not treat you too well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is warm-tempered, but he is a good husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He speaks roughly to you, and sometimes even threatens to
lock you out of doors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only once, Fred!&nbsp; On my honour, only once.&nbsp; The
Duke is a fairly good husband, I repeat.&nbsp; But you deserve punishment
for this night&rsquo;s trick of drawing me out.&nbsp; What does it mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harriet, dearest, is this fair or honest?&nbsp; Is it not
notorious that your life with him is a sad one&mdash;that, in spite
of the sweetness of your temper, the sourness of his embitters your
days.&nbsp; I have come to know if I can help you.&nbsp; You are a Duchess,
and I am Fred Ogbourne; but it is not impossible that I may be able
to help you . . . By God! the sweetness of that tongue ought to keep
him civil, especially when there is added to it the sweetness of that
face!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Ogbourne!&rsquo; she exclaimed, with an emphasis of
playful fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can such a comrade of my youth behave
to me as you do?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t speak so, and stare at me so!&nbsp;
Is this really all you have to say?&nbsp; I see I ought not to have
come.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas thoughtlessly done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another breeze broke the thread of discourse for a time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; I perceive you are dead and lost to me,&rsquo;
he could next be heard to say, &lsquo;&ldquo;Captain Ogbourne&rdquo;
proves that.&nbsp; As I once loved you I love you now, Harriet, without
one jot of abatement; but you are not the woman you were&mdash;you once
were honest towards me; and now you conceal your heart in made-up speeches.&nbsp;
Let it be: I can never see you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not say that in such a tragedy tone, you silly.&nbsp;
You may see me in an ordinary way&mdash;why should you not?&nbsp; But,
of course, not in such a way as this.&nbsp; I should not have come now,
if it had not happened that the Duke is away from home, so that there
is nobody to check my erratic impulses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When does he return?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day after to-morrow, or the day after that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then meet me again to-morrow night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Fred, I cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you cannot to-morrow night, you can the night after; one
of the two before he comes please bestow on me.&nbsp; Now, your hand
upon it!&nbsp; To-morrow or next night you will see me to bid me farewell!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He seized the Duchess&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but Fred&mdash;let go my hand!&nbsp; What do you mean
by holding me so?&nbsp; If it be love to forget all respect to a woman&rsquo;s
present position in thinking of her past, then yours may be so, Frederick.&nbsp;
It is not kind and gentle of you to induce me to come to this place
for pity of you, and then to hold me tight here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But see me once more!&nbsp; I have come two thousand miles
to ask it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I must not!&nbsp; There will be slanders&mdash;Heaven knows
what!&nbsp; I cannot meet you.&nbsp; For the sake of old times don&rsquo;t
ask it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then own two things to me; that you did love me once, and
that your husband is unkind to you often enough now to make you think
of the time when you cared for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I own them both,&rsquo; she answered faintly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But owning such as that tells against me; and I swear the inference
is not true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that; for you have come&mdash;let me think
the reason of your coming what I like to think it.&nbsp; It can do you
no harm.&nbsp; Come once more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He still held her hand and waist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thus far you shall persuade me.&nbsp; I will
meet you to-morrow night or the night after.&nbsp; Now, let me go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He released her, and they parted.&nbsp; The Duchess ran rapidly down
the hill towards the outlying mansion of Shakeforest Towers, and when
he had watched her out of sight, he turned and strode off in the opposite
direction.&nbsp; All then was silent and empty as before.</p>
<p>Yet it was only for a moment.&nbsp; When they had quite departed,
another shape appeared upon the scene.&nbsp; He came from behind the
trilithon.&nbsp; He was a man of stouter build than the first, and wore
the boots and spurs of a horseman.&nbsp; Two things were at once obvious
from this phenomenon: that he had watched the interview between the
Captain and the Duchess; and that, though he probably had seen every
movement of the couple, including the embrace, he had been too remote
to hear the reluctant words of the lady&rsquo;s conversation&mdash;or,
indeed, any words at all&mdash;so that the meeting must have exhibited
itself to his eye as the assignation of a pair of well-agreed lovers.&nbsp;
But it was necessary that several years should elapse before the shepherd-boy
was old enough to reason out this.</p>
<p>The third individual stood still for a moment, as if deep in meditation.&nbsp;
He crossed over to where the lady and gentleman had stood, and looked
at the ground; then he too turned and went away in a third direction,
as widely divergent as possible from those taken by the two interlocutors.&nbsp;
His course was towards the highway; and a few minutes afterwards the
trot of a horse might have been heard upon its frosty surface, lessening
till it died away upon the ear.</p>
<p>The boy remained in the hut, confronting the trilithon as if he expected
yet more actors on the scene, but nobody else appeared.&nbsp; How long
he stood with his little face against the loophole he hardly knew; but
he was rudely awakened from his reverie by a punch in his back, and
in the feel of it he familiarly recognized the stem of the old shepherd&rsquo;s
crook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blame thy young eyes and limbs, Bill Mills&mdash;now you have
let the fire out, and you know I want it kept in!&nbsp; I thought something
would go wrong with &rsquo;ee up here, and I couldn&rsquo;t bide in
bed no more than thistledown on the wind, that I could not!&nbsp; Well,
what&rsquo;s happened, fie upon &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ewes all as I left &rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any lambs want bringing in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd relit the fire, and went out among the sheep with a
lantern, for the moon was getting low.&nbsp; Soon he came in again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blame it all&mdash;thou&rsquo;st say that nothing have happened;
when one ewe have twinned and is like to go off, and another is dying
for want of half an eye of looking to!&nbsp; I told &rsquo;ee, Bill
Mills, if anything went wrong to come down and call me; and this is
how you have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said I could go to sleep for a hollerday, and I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you speak to your betters like that, young man,
or you&rsquo;ll come to the gallows-tree!&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t sleep
all the time, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have been peeping out of that there
hole!&nbsp; Now you can go home, and be up here again by breakfast-time.&nbsp;
I be an old man, and there&rsquo;s old men that deserve well of the
world; but no I&mdash;must rest how I can!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The elder shepherd then lay down inside the hut, and the boy went
down the hill to the hamlet where he dwelt.</p>
<h3>SECOND NIGHT</h3>
<p>When the next night drew on the actions of the boy were almost enough
to show that he was thinking of the meeting he had witnessed, and of
the promise wrung from the lady that she would come there again.&nbsp;
As far as the sheep-tending arrangements were concerned, to-night was
but a repetition of the foregoing one.&nbsp; Between ten and eleven
o&rsquo;clock the old shepherd withdrew as usual for what sleep at home
he might chance to get without interruption, making up the other necessary
hours of rest at some time during the day; the boy was left alone.</p>
<p>The frost was the same as on the night before, except perhaps that
it was a little more severe.&nbsp; The moon shone as usual, except that
it was three-quarters of an hour later in its course; and the boy&rsquo;s
condition was much the same, except that he felt no sleepiness whatever.&nbsp;
He felt, too, rather afraid; but upon the whole he preferred witnessing
an assignation of strangers to running the risk of being discovered
absent by the old shepherd.</p>
<p>It was before the distant clock of Shakeforest Towers had struck
eleven that he observed the opening of the second act of this midnight
drama.&nbsp; It consisted in the appearance of neither lover nor Duchess,
but of the third figure&mdash;the stout man, booted and spurred&mdash;who
came up from the easterly direction in which he had retreated the night
before.&nbsp; He walked once round the trilithon, and next advanced
towards the clump concealing the hut, the moonlight shining full upon
his face and revealing him to be the Duke.&nbsp; Fear seized upon the
shepherd-boy: the Duke was Jove himself to the rural population, whom
to offend was starvation, homelessness, and death, and whom to look
at was to be mentally scathed and dumbfoundered.&nbsp; He closed the
stove, so that not a spark of light appeared, and hastily buried himself
in the straw that lay in a corner.</p>
<p>The Duke came close to the clump of furze and stood by the spot where
his wife and the Captain had held their dialogue; he examined the furze
as if searching for a hiding-place, and in doing so discovered the hut.&nbsp;
The latter he walked round and then looked inside; finding it to all
seeming empty, he entered, closing the door behind him and taking his
place at the little circular window against which the boy&rsquo;s face
had been pressed just before.</p>
<p>The Duke had not adopted his measures too rapidly, if his object
were concealment.&nbsp; Almost as soon as he had stationed himself there
eleven o&rsquo;clock struck, and the slender young man who had previously
graced the scene promptly reappeared from the north quarter of the down.&nbsp;
The spot of assignation having, by the accident of his running forward
on the foregoing night, removed itself from the Devil&rsquo;s Door to
the clump of furze, he instinctively came thither, and waited for the
Duchess where he had met her before.</p>
<p>But a fearful surprise was in store for him to-night, as well as
for the trembling juvenile.&nbsp; At his appearance the Duke breathed
more and more quickly, his breathings being distinctly audible to the
crouching boy.&nbsp; The young man had hardly paused when the alert
nobleman softly opened the door of the hut, and, stepping round the
furze, came full upon Captain Fred.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have dishonoured her, and you shall die the death you
deserve!&rsquo; came to the shepherd&rsquo;s ears, in a harsh, hollow
whisper through the boarding of the hut.</p>
<p>The apathetic and taciturn boy was excited enough to run the risk
of rising and looking from the window, but he could see nothing for
the intervening furze boughs, both the men having gone round to the
side.&nbsp; What took place in the few following moments he never exactly
knew.&nbsp; He discerned portion of a shadow in quick muscular movement;
then there was the fall of something on the grass; then there was stillness.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later the Duke became visible round the corner
of the hut, dragging by the collar the now inert body of the second
man.&nbsp; The Duke dragged him across the open space towards the trilithon.&nbsp;
Behind this ruin was a hollow, irregular spot, overgrown with furze
and stunted thorns, and riddled by the old holes of badgers, its former
inhabitants, who had now died out or departed.&nbsp; The Duke vanished
into this depression with his burden, reappearing after the lapse of
a few seconds.&nbsp; When he came forth he dragged nothing behind him.</p>
<p>He returned to the side of the hut, cleansed something on the grass,
and again put himself on the watch, though not as before, inside the
hut, but without, on the shady side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now for the second!&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>It was plain, even to the unsophisticated boy, that he now awaited
the other person of the appointment&mdash;his wife, the Duchess&mdash;for
what purpose it was terrible to think.&nbsp; He seemed to be a man of
such determined temper that he would scarcely hesitate in carrying out
a course of revenge to the bitter end.&nbsp; Moreover&mdash;though it
was what the shepherd did not perceive&mdash;this was all the more probable,
in that the moody Duke was labouring under the exaggerated impression
which the sight of the meeting in dumb show had conveyed.</p>
<p>The jealous watcher waited long, but he waited in vain.&nbsp; From
within the hut the boy could hear his occasional exclamations of surprise,
as if he were almost disappointed at the failure of his assumption that
his guilty Duchess would surely keep the tryst.&nbsp; Sometimes he stepped
from the shade of the furze into the moonlight, and held up his watch
to learn the time.</p>
<p>About half-past eleven he seemed to give up expecting her.&nbsp;
He then went a second time to the hollow behind the trilithon, remaining
there nearly a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; From this place he proceeded
quickly over a shoulder of the declivity, a little to the left, presently
returning on horseback, which proved that his horse had been tethered
in some secret place down there.&nbsp; Crossing anew the down between
the hut and the trilithon, and scanning the precincts as if finally
to assure himself that she had not come, he rode slowly downwards in
the direction of Shakeforest Towers.</p>
<p>The juvenile shepherd thought of what lay in the hollow yonder; and
no fear of the crook-stem of his superior officer was potent enough
to detain him longer on that hill alone.&nbsp; Any live company, even
the most terrible, was better than the company of the dead; so, running
with the speed of a hare in the direction pursued by the horseman, he
overtook the revengeful Duke at the second descent (where the great
western road crossed before you came to the old park entrance on that
side&mdash;now closed up and the lodge cleared away, though at the time
it was wondered why, being considered the most convenient gate of all).</p>
<p>Once within the sound of the horse&rsquo;s footsteps, Bill Mills
felt comparatively comfortable; for, though in awe of the Duke because
of his position, he had no moral repugnance to his companionship on
account of the grisly deed he had committed, considering that powerful
nobleman to have a right to do what he chose on his own lands.&nbsp;
The Duke rode steadily on beneath his ancestral trees, the hoofs of
his horse sending up a smart sound now that he had reached the hard
road of the drive, and soon drew near the front door of his house, surmounted
by parapets with square-cut battlements that cast a notched shade upon
the gravelled terrace.&nbsp; These outlines were quite familiar to little
Bill Mills, though nothing within their boundary had ever been seen
by him.</p>
<p>When the rider approached the mansion a small turret door was quickly
opened and a woman came out.&nbsp; As soon as she saw the horseman&rsquo;s
outlines she ran forward into the moonlight to meet him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah dear&mdash;and are you come?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
heard Hero&rsquo;s tread just when you rode over the hill, and I knew
it in a moment.&nbsp; I would have come further if I had been aware&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad to see me, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you ask that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; it is a lovely night for meetings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is a lovely night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke dismounted and stood by her side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should
you have been listening at this time of night, and yet not expecting
me?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, indeed!&nbsp; There is a strange story attached to that,
which I must tell you at once.&nbsp; But why did you come a night sooner
than you said you would come?&nbsp; I am rather sorry&mdash;I really
am!&rsquo; (shaking her head playfully) &lsquo;for as a surprise to
you I had ordered a bonfire to be built, which was to be lighted on
your arrival to-morrow; and now it is wasted.&nbsp; You can see the
outline of it just out there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke looked across to a spot of rising glade, and saw the faggots
in a heap.&nbsp; He then bent his eyes with a bland and puzzled air
on the ground, &lsquo;What is this strange story you have to tell me
that kept you awake?&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is this&mdash;and it is really rather serious.&nbsp; My
cousin Fred Ogbourne&mdash;Captain Ogbourne as he is now&mdash;was in
his boyhood a great admirer of mine, as I think I have told you, though
I was six years his senior.&nbsp; In strict truth, he was absurdly fond
of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have never told me of that before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it was your sister I told&mdash;yes, it was.&nbsp; Well,
you know I have not seen him for many years, and naturally I had quite
forgotten his admiration of me in old times.&nbsp; But guess my surprise
when the day before yesterday, I received a mysterious note bearing
no address, and found on opening it that it came from him.&nbsp; The
contents frightened me out of my wits.&nbsp; He had returned from Canada
to his father&rsquo;s house, and conjured me by all he could think of
to meet him at once.&nbsp; But I think I can repeat the exact words,
though I will show it to you when we get indoors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY DEAR COUSIN HARRIET,&rdquo; the note said,
&ldquo;After this long absence you will be surprised at my sudden reappearance,
and more by what I am going to ask.&nbsp; But if my life and future
are of any concern to you at all, I beg that you will grant my request.&nbsp;
What I require of you, is, dear Harriet, that you meet me about eleven
to-night by the Druid stones on Marlbury Downs, about a mile or more
from your house.&nbsp; I cannot say more, except to entreat you to come.&nbsp;
I will explain all when you are there.&nbsp; The one thing is, I want
to see you.&nbsp; Come alone.&nbsp; Believe me, I would not ask this
if my happiness did not hang upon it&mdash;God knows how entirely!&nbsp;
I am too agitated to say more&mdash;Yours.&nbsp; FRED.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;That was all of it.&nbsp; Now, of course I ought have gone,
as it turned out, but that I did not think of then.&nbsp; I remembered
his impetuous temper, and feared that something grievous was impending
over his head, while he had not a friend in the world to help him, or
any one except myself to whom he would care to make his trouble known.&nbsp;
So I wrapped myself up and went to Marlbury Downs at the time he had
named.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think I was courageous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I got there&mdash;but shall we not walk on; it is getting
cold?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Duke, however, did not move.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
I got there he came, of course, as a full grown man and officer, and
not as the lad that I had known him.&nbsp; When I saw him I was sorry
I had come.&nbsp; I can hardly tell you how he behaved.&nbsp; What he
wanted I don&rsquo;t know even now; it seemed to be no more than the
mere meeting with me.&nbsp; He held me by the hand and waist&mdash;O
so tight&mdash;and would not let me go till I had promised to meet him
again.&nbsp; His manner was so strange and passionate that I was afraid
of him in such a lonely place, and I promised to come.&nbsp; Then I
escaped&mdash;then I ran home&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; When
the time drew on this evening for the appointment&mdash;which, of course,
I never intended to keep, I felt uneasy, lest when he found I meant
to disappoint him he would come on to the house; and that&rsquo;s why
I could not sleep.&nbsp; But you are so silent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had a long journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let us get into the house.&nbsp; Why did you come alone
and unattended like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was my humour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which they moved on, she said,
&lsquo;I have thought of something which I hardly like to suggest to
you.&nbsp; He said that if I failed to come to-night he would wait again
to-morrow night.&nbsp; Now, shall we to-morrow night go to the hill
together&mdash;just to see if he is there; and if he is, read him a
lesson on his foolishness in nourishing this old passion, and sending
for me so oddly, instead of coming to the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should we see if he&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said her husband
moodily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I think we ought to do something in it.&nbsp; Poor
Fred!&nbsp; He would listen to you if you reasoned with him, and set
our positions in their true light before him.&nbsp; It would be no more
than Christian kindness to a man who unquestionably is very miserable
from some cause or other.&nbsp; His head seems quite turned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the door, rung the bell, and waited.&nbsp;
All the house seemed to be asleep; but soon a man came to them, the
horse was taken away, and the Duke and Duchess went in.</p>
<h3>THIRD NIGHT</h3>
<p>There was no help for it.&nbsp; Bill Mills was obliged to stay on
duty, in the old shepherd&rsquo;s absence, this evening as before, or
give up his post and living.&nbsp; He thought as bravely as he could
of what lay behind the Devil&rsquo;s Door, but with no great success,
and was therefore in a measure relieved, even if awe-stricken, when
he saw the forms of the Duke and Duchess strolling across the frosted
greensward.&nbsp; The Duchess was a few yards in front of her husband
and tripped on lightly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you he has not thought it worth while to come again!&rsquo;
the Duke insisted, as he stood still, reluctant to walk further.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is more likely to come and wait all night; and it would
be harsh treatment to let him do it a second time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not here; so turn and come home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seems not to be here, certainly; I wonder if anything has
happened to him.&nbsp; If it has, I shall never forgive myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke, uneasily, &lsquo;O, no.&nbsp; He has some other engagement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is very unlikely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or perhaps he has found the distance too far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor is that probable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he may have thought better of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he may have thought better of it; if, indeed, he is not
here all the time&mdash;somewhere in the hollow behind the Devil&rsquo;s
Door.&nbsp; Let us go and see; it will serve him right to surprise him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he&rsquo;s not there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may be lying very quiet because of you,&rsquo; she said
archly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, no&mdash;not because of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, then.&nbsp; I declare, dearest, you lag like an unwilling
schoolboy to-night, and there&rsquo;s no responsiveness in you!&nbsp;
You are jealous of that poor lad, and it is quite absurd of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come!&nbsp; Say no more,
Harriet!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they crossed over the green.</p>
<p>Wondering what they would do, the young shepherd left the hut, and
doubled behind the belt of furze, intending to stand near the trilithon
unperceived.&nbsp; But, in crossing the few yards of open ground he
was for a moment exposed to view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I see him at last!&rsquo; said the Duchess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See him!&rsquo; said the Duke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the Devil&rsquo;s Door; don&rsquo;t you notice a figure
there?&nbsp; Ah, my poor lover-cousin, won&rsquo;t you catch it now?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And she laughed half-pityingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
she asked, turning to her husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not he!&rsquo; said the Duke hoarsely.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
can&rsquo;t be he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it is not he.&nbsp; It is too small for him.&nbsp; It
is a boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I thought so!&nbsp; Boy, come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youthful shepherd advanced with apprehension.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keeping sheep, your Grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you know me!&nbsp; Do you keep sheep here every night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Off and on, my Lord Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what have you seen here to-night or last night?&rsquo;
inquired the Duchess.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any person waiting or walking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has seen nothing,&rsquo; interrupted her husband, his eyes
so forbiddingly fixed on the boy that they seemed to shine like points
of fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, let us go.&nbsp; The air is too keen to
stand in long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they were gone the boy retreated to the hut and sheep, less
fearful now than at first&mdash;familiarity with the situation having
gradually overpowered his thoughts of the buried man.&nbsp; But he was
not to be left alone long.&nbsp; When an interval had elapsed of about
sufficient length for walking to and from Shakeforest Towers, there
appeared from that direction the heavy form of the Duke.&nbsp; He now
came alone.</p>
<p>The nobleman, on his part, seemed to have eyes no less sharp than
the boy&rsquo;s, for he instantly recognized the latter among the ewes,
and came straight towards him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you the shepherd lad I spoke to a short time ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be, my Lord Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now listen to me.&nbsp; Her Grace asked you what you had seen
this last night or two up here, and you made no reply.&nbsp; I now ask
the same thing, and you need not be afraid to answer.&nbsp; Have you
seen anything strange these nights you have been watching here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Lord Duke, I be a poor heedless boy, and what I see I don&rsquo;t
bear in mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask you again,&rsquo; said the Duke, coming nearer, &lsquo;have
you seen anything strange these nights you have been watching here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my Lord Duke!&nbsp; I be but the under-shepherd boy, and
my father he was but your humble Grace&rsquo;s hedger, and my mother
only the cinder-woman in the back-yard!&nbsp; I fall asleep when left
alone, and I see nothing at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke grasped the boy by the shoulder, and, directly impending
over him, stared down into his face, &lsquo;Did you see anything strange
done here last night, I say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my Lord Duke, have mercy, and don&rsquo;t stab me!&rsquo;
cried the shepherd, falling on his knees.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never
seen you walking here, or riding here, or lying-in-wait for a man, or
dragging a heavy load!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said his interrogator, grimly, relaxing
his hold.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is well to know that you have never seen those
things.&nbsp; Now, which would you rather&mdash;<i>see me do those things
now</i>, or keep a secret all your life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep a secret, my Lord Duke!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure you are able?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, your Grace, try me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; And now, how do you like sheep-keeping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis lonely work for them that think
of spirits, and I&rsquo;m badly used.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you.&nbsp; You are too young for it.&nbsp; I must
do something to make you more comfortable.&nbsp; You shall change this
smock-frock for a real cloth jacket, and your thick boots for polished
shoes.&nbsp; And you shall be taught what you have never yet heard of;
and be put to school, and have bats and balls for the holidays, and
be made a man of.&nbsp; But you must never say you have been a shepherd
boy, and watched on the hills at night, for shepherd boys are not liked
in good company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust me, my Lord Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very moment you forget yourself, and speak of your shepherd
days&mdash;this year, next year, in school, out of school, or riding
in your carriage twenty years hence&mdash;at that moment my help will
be withdrawn, and smash down you come to shepherding forthwith.&nbsp;
You have parents, I think you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A widowed mother only, my Lord Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll provide for her, and make a comfortable woman of
her, until you speak of&mdash;what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of my shepherd days, and what I saw here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good.&nbsp; If you do speak of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smash down she comes to widowing forthwith!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s well&mdash;very well.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not
enough.&nbsp; Come here.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took the boy across to the
trilithon, and made him kneel down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, this was once a holy place,&rsquo; resumed the Duke.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An altar stood here, erected to a venerable family of gods, who
were known and talked of long before the God we know now.&nbsp; So that
an oath sworn here is doubly an oath.&nbsp; Say this after me: &ldquo;May
all the host above&mdash;angels and archangels, and principalities and
powers&mdash;punish me; may I be tormented wherever I am&mdash;in the
house or in the garden, in the fields or in the roads, in church or
in chapel, at home or abroad, on land or at sea; may I be afflicted
in eating and in drinking, in growing up and in growing old, in living
and dying, inwardly and outwardly, and for always, if I ever speak of
my life as a shepherd boy, or of what I have seen done on this Marlbury
Down.&nbsp; So be it, and so let it be.&nbsp; Amen and amen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now kiss the stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trembling boy repeated the words, and kissed the stone, as desired.</p>
<p>The Duke led him off by the hand.&nbsp; That night the junior shepherd
slept in Shakeforest Towers, and the next day he was sent away for tuition
to a remote village.&nbsp; Thence he went to a preparatory establishment,
and in due course to a public school.</p>
<h3>FOURTH NIGHT</h3>
<p>On a winter evening many years subsequent to the above-mentioned
occurrences, the <i>ci-devant</i> shepherd sat in a well-furnished office
in the north wing of Shakeforest Towers in the guise of an ordinary
educated man of business.&nbsp; He appeared at this time as a person
of thirty-eight or forty, though actually he was several years younger.&nbsp;
A worn and restless glance of the eye now and then, when he lifted his
head to search for some letter or paper which had been mislaid, seemed
to denote that his was not a mind so thoroughly at ease as his surroundings
might have led an observer to expect.</p>
<p>His pallor, too, was remarkable for a countryman.&nbsp; He was professedly
engaged in writing, but he shaped not word.&nbsp; He had sat there only
a few minutes, when, laying down his pen and pushing back his chair,
he rested a hand uneasily on each of the chair-arms and looked on the
floor.</p>
<p>Soon he arose and left the room.&nbsp; His course was along a passage
which ended in a central octagonal hall; crossing this he knocked at
a door.&nbsp; A faint, though deep, voice told him to come in.&nbsp;
The room he entered was the library, and it was tenanted by a single
person only&mdash;his patron the Duke.</p>
<p>During this long interval of years the Duke had lost all his heaviness
of build.&nbsp; He was, indeed, almost a skeleton; his white hair was
thin, and his hands were nearly transparent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh&mdash;Mills?&rsquo;
he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit down.&nbsp; What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing new, your Grace.&nbsp; Nobody to speak of has written,
and nobody has called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;what then?&nbsp; You look concerned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old times have come to life, owing to something waking them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old times be cursed&mdash;which old times are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Christmas week twenty-two years ago, when the late Duchess&rsquo;s
cousin Frederick implored her to meet him on Marlbury Downs.&nbsp; I
saw the meeting&mdash;it was just such a night as this&mdash;and I,
as you know, saw more.&nbsp; She met him once, but not the second time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mills, shall I recall some words to you&mdash;the words of
an oath taken on that hill by a shepherd-boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is unnecessary.&nbsp; He has strenuously kept that oath
and promise.&nbsp; Since that night no sound of his shepherd life has
crossed his lips&mdash;even to yourself.&nbsp; But do you wish to hear
more, or do you not, your Grace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to hear no more,&rsquo; said the Duke sullenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; let it be so.&nbsp; But a time seems coming&mdash;may
be quite near at hand&mdash;when, in spite of my lips, that episode
will allow itself to go undivulged no longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to hear no more!&rsquo; repeated the Duke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need be under no fear of treachery from me,&rsquo; said
the steward, somewhat bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a man to whom you
have been kind&mdash;no patron could have been kinder.&nbsp; You have
clothed and educated me; have installed me here; and I am not unmindful.&nbsp;
But what of it&mdash;has your Grace gained much by my stanchness?&nbsp;
I think not.&nbsp; There was great excitement about Captain Ogbourne&rsquo;s
disappearance, but I spoke not a word.&nbsp; And his body has never
been found.&nbsp; For twenty-two years I have wondered what you did
with him.&nbsp; Now I know.&nbsp; A circumstance that occurred this
afternoon recalled the time to me most forcibly.&nbsp; To make it certain
to myself that all was not a dream, I went up there with a spade; I
searched, and saw enough to know that something decays there in a closed
badger&rsquo;s hole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mills, do you think the Duchess guessed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She never did, I am sure, to the day of her death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you leave all as you found it on the hill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What made you think of going up there this particular afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What your Grace says you don&rsquo;t wish to be told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke was silent; and the stillness of the evening was so marked
that there reached their ears from the outer air the sound of a tolling
bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that bell tolling for?&rsquo; asked the nobleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For what I came to tell you of, your Grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You torment me it is your way!&rsquo; said the Duke querulously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s dead in the village?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The oldest man&mdash;the old shepherd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead at last&mdash;how old is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ninety-four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am only seventy.&nbsp; I have four-and-twenty years
to the good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I served under that old man when I kept sheep on Marlbury
Downs.&nbsp; And he was on the hill that second night, when I first
exchanged words with your Grace.&nbsp; He was on the hill all the time;
but I did not know he was there&mdash;nor did you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Duke, starting up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go on&mdash;I
yield the point&mdash;you may tell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard this afternoon that he was at the point of death.&nbsp;
It was that which set me thinking of that past time&mdash;and induced
me to search on the hill for what I have told you.&nbsp; Coming back
I heard that he wished to see the Vicar to confess to him a secret he
had kept for more than twenty years&mdash;&ldquo;out of respect to my
Lord the Duke&rdquo;&mdash;something that he had seen committed on Marlbury
Downs when returning to the flock on a December night twenty-two years
ago.&nbsp; I have thought it over.&nbsp; He had left me in charge that
evening; but he was in the habit of coming back suddenly, lest I should
have fallen asleep.&nbsp; That night I saw nothing of him, though he
had promised to return.&nbsp; He must have returned, and&mdash;found
reason to keep in hiding.&nbsp; It is all plain.&nbsp; The next thing
is that the Vicar went to him two hours ago.&nbsp; Further than that
I have not heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite enough.&nbsp; I will see the Vicar at daybreak
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop his tongue for four-and-twenty years&mdash;till I am
dead at ninety-four, like the shepherd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Grace&mdash;while you impose silence on me, I will not
speak, even though nay neck should pay the penalty.&nbsp; I promised
to be yours, and I am yours.&nbsp; But is this persistence of any avail?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stop his tongue, I say!&rsquo; cried the Duke with
some of his old rugged force.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, you go home to bed,
Mills, and leave me to manage him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The interview ended, and the steward withdrew.&nbsp; The night, as
he had said, was just such an one as the night of twenty-two years before,
and the events of the evening destroyed in him all regard for the season
as one of cheerfulness and goodwill.&nbsp; He went off to his own house
on the further verge of the park, where he led a lonely life, scarcely
calling any man friend.&nbsp; At eleven he prepared to retire to bed&mdash;but
did not retire.&nbsp; He sat down and reflected.&nbsp; Twelve o&rsquo;clock
struck; he looked out at the colourless moon, and, prompted by he knew
not what, put on his hat and emerged into the air.&nbsp; Here William
Mills strolled on and on, till he reached the top of Marlbury Downs,
a spot he had not visited at this hour of the night during the whole
score-and-odd years.</p>
<p>He placed himself, as nearly as he could guess, on the spot where
the shepherd&rsquo;s hut had stood.&nbsp; No lambing was in progress
there now, and the old shepherd who had used him so roughly had ceased
from his labours that very day.&nbsp; But the trilithon stood up white
as ever; and, crossing the intervening sward, the steward fancifully
placed his mouth against the stone.&nbsp; Restless and self-reproachful
as he was, he could not resist a smile as he thought of the terrifying
oath of compact, sealed by a kiss upon the stones of a Pagan temple.&nbsp;
But he had kept his word, rather as a promise than as a formal vow,
with much worldly advantage to himself, though not much happiness; till
increase of years had bred reactionary feelings which led him to receive
the news of to-night with emotions akin to relief.</p>
<p>While leaning against the Devil&rsquo;s Door and thinking on these
things, he became conscious that he was not the only inhabitant of the
down.&nbsp; A figure in white was moving across his front with long,
noiseless strides.&nbsp; Mills stood motionless, and when the form drew
quite near he perceived it to be that of the Duke himself in his nightshirt&mdash;apparently
walking in his sleep.&nbsp; Not to alarm the old man, Mills clung close
to the shadow of the stone.&nbsp; The Duke went straight on into the
hollow.&nbsp; There he knelt down, and began scratching the earth with
his hands like a badger.&nbsp; After a few minutes he arose, sighed
heavily, and retraced his steps as he had come.</p>
<p>Fearing that he might harm himself, yet unwilling to arouse him,
the steward followed noiselessly.&nbsp; The Duke kept on his path unerringly,
entered the park, and made for the house, where he let himself in by
a window that stood open&mdash;the one probably by which he had come
out.&nbsp; Mills softly closed the window behind his patron, and then
retired homeward to await the revelations of the morning, deeming it
unnecessary to alarm the house.</p>
<p>However, he felt uneasy during the remainder of the night, no less
on account of the Duke&rsquo;s personal condition than because of that
which was imminent next day.&nbsp; Early in the morning he called at
Shakeforest Towers.&nbsp; The blinds were down, and there was something
singular upon the porter&rsquo;s face when he opened the door.&nbsp;
The steward inquired for the Duke.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s voice was subdued as he replied: &lsquo;Sir, I am
sorry to say that his Grace is dead!&nbsp; He left his room some time
in the night, and wandered about nobody knows where.&nbsp; On returning
to the upper floor he lost his balance and fell downstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The steward told the tale of the Down before the Vicar had spoken.&nbsp;
Mills had always intended to do so after the death of the Duke.&nbsp;
The consequences to himself he underwent cheerfully; but his life was
not prolonged.&nbsp; He died, a farmer at the Cape, when still somewhat
under forty-nine years of age.</p>
<p>The splendid Marlbury breeding flock is as renowned as ever, and,
to the eye, seems the same in every particular that it was in earlier
times; but the animals which composed it on the occasion of the events
gathered from the Justice are divided by many ovine generations from
its members now.&nbsp; Lambing Corner has long since ceased to be used
for lambing purposes, though the name still lingers on as the appellation
of the spot.&nbsp; This abandonment of site may be partly owing to the
removal of the high furze bushes which lent such convenient shelter
at that date.&nbsp; Partly, too, it may be due to another circumstance.&nbsp;
For it is said by present shepherds in that district that during the
nights of Christmas week flitting shapes are seen in the open space
around the trilithon, together with the gleam of a weapon, and the shadow
of a man dragging a burden into the hollow.&nbsp; But of these things
there is no certain testimony.</p>
<p><i>Christmas</i> 1881.</p>
<h2>A COMMITTEE-MAN OF &lsquo;THE TERROR&rsquo;</h2>
<p>We had been talking of the Georgian glories of our old-fashioned
watering-place, which now, with its substantial russet-red and dun brick
buildings in the style of the year eighteen hundred, looks like one
side of a Soho or Bloomsbury Street transported to the shore, and draws
a smile from the modern tourist who has no eye for solidity of build.&nbsp;
The writer, quite a youth, was present merely as a listener.&nbsp; The
conversation proceeded from general subjects to particular, until old
Mrs. H--, whose memory was as perfect at eighty as it had ever been
in her life, interested us all by the obvious fidelity with which she
repeated a story many times related to her by her mother when our aged
friend was a girl&mdash;a domestic drama much affecting the life of
an acquaintance of her said parent, one Mademoiselle V--, a teacher
of French.&nbsp; The incidents occurred in the town during the heyday
of its fortunes, at the time of our brief peace with France in 1802-3.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote it down in the shape of a story some years ago, just
after my mother&rsquo;s death,&rsquo; said Mrs. H--.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is locked up in my desk there now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Read it!&rsquo; said we.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;the light is bad, and I can remember
it well enough, word for word, flourishes and all.&rsquo;&nbsp; We could
not be choosers in the circumstances, and she began.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are two in it, of course, the man and the woman, and
it was on an evening in September that she first got to know him.&nbsp;
There had not been such a grand gathering on the Esplanade all the season.&nbsp;
His Majesty King George the Third was present, with all the princesses
and royal dukes, while upwards of three hundred of the general nobility
and other persons of distinction were also in the town at the time.&nbsp;
Carriages and other conveyances were arriving every minute from London
and elsewhere; and when among the rest a shabby stage-coach came in
by a by-route along the coast from Havenpool, and drew up at a second-rate
tavern, it attracted comparatively little notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From this dusty vehicle a man alighted, left his small quantity
of luggage temporarily at the office, and walked along the street as
if to look for lodgings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was about forty-five&mdash;possibly fifty&mdash;and wore
a long coat of faded superfine cloth, with a heavy collar, and a hunched-up
neckcloth.&nbsp; He seemed to desire obscurity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the display appeared presently to strike him, and he asked
of a rustic he met in the street what was going on; his accent being
that of one to whom English pronunciation was difficult.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The countryman looked at him with a slight surprise, and said,
&ldquo;King Jarge is here and his royal Cwort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The stranger inquired if they were going to stay long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, Sir.&nbsp; Same as they always do,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How long is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Till some time in October.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve come
here every summer since eighty-nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The stranger moved onward down St. Thomas Street, and approached
the bridge over the harbour backwater, that then, as now, connected
the old town with the more modern portion.&nbsp; The spot was swept
with the rays of a low sun, which lit up the harbour lengthwise, and
shone under the brim of the man&rsquo;s hat and into his eyes as he
looked westward.&nbsp; Against the radiance figures were crossing in
the opposite direction to his own; among them this lady of my mother&rsquo;s
later acquaintance, Mademoiselle V--.&nbsp; She was the daughter of
a good old French family, and at that date a pale woman, twenty-eight
or thirty years of age, tall and elegant in figure, but plainly dressed
and wearing that evening (she said) a small muslin shawl crossed over
the bosom in the fashion of the time, and tied behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At sight of his face, which, as she used to tell us, was unusually
distinct in the peering sunlight, she could not help giving a little
shriek of horror, for a terrible reason connected with her history,
and after walking a few steps further, she sank down against the parapet
of the bridge in a fainting fit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In his preoccupation the foreign gentleman had hardly noticed
her, but her strange collapse immediately attracted his attention.&nbsp;
He quickly crossed the carriageway, picked her up, and carried her into
the first shop adjoining the bridge, explaining that she was a lady
who had been taken ill outside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She soon revived; but, clearly much puzzled, her helper perceived
that she still had a dread of him which was sufficient to hinder her
complete recovery of self-command.&nbsp; She spoke in a quick and nervous
way to the shopkeeper, asking him to call a coach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This the shopkeeper did, Mademoiselle V--- and the stranger
remaining in constrained silence while he was gone.&nbsp; The coach
came up, and giving the man the address, she entered it and drove away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who is that lady?&rdquo; said the newly arrived gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s of your nation, as I should make bold to
suppose,&rdquo; said the shopkeeper.&nbsp; And he told the other that
she was Mademoiselle V--, governess at General Newbold&rsquo;s, in the
same town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You have many foreigners here?&rdquo; the stranger
inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, though mostly Hanoverians.&nbsp; But since the
peace they are learning French a good deal in genteel society, and French
instructors are rather in demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, I teach it,&rdquo; said the visitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am looking for a tutorship in an academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The information given by the burgess to the Frenchman seemed
to explain to the latter nothing of his countrywoman&rsquo;s conduct&mdash;which,
indeed, was the case&mdash;and he left the shop, taking his course again
over the bridge and along the south quay to the Old Rooms Inn, where
he engaged a bedchamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thoughts of the woman who had betrayed such agitation at sight
of him lingered naturally enough with the newcomer.&nbsp; Though, as
I stated, not much less than thirty years of age, Mademoiselle V--,
one of his own nation, and of highly refined and delicate appearance,
had kindled a singular interest in the middle-aged gentleman&rsquo;s
breast, and her large dark eyes, as they had opened and shrunk from
him, exhibited a pathetic beauty to which hardly any man could have
been insensible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day, having written some letters, he went out and
made known at the office of the town &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; and of the
newspaper, that a teacher of French and calligraphy had arrived, leaving
a card at the bookseller&rsquo;s to the same effect.&nbsp; He then walked
on aimlessly, but at length inquired the way to General Newbold&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
At the door, without giving his name, he asked to see Mademoiselle V--,
and was shown into a little back parlour, where she came to him with
a gaze of surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My God!&nbsp; Why do you intrude here, Monsieur?&rdquo;
she gasped in French as soon as she saw his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You were taken ill yesterday.&nbsp; I helped you.&nbsp;
You might have been run over if I had not picked you up.&nbsp; It was
an act of simple humanity certainly; but I thought I might come to ask
if you had recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She had turned aside, and had scarcely heard a word of his
speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate you, infamous man!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot bear your helping me.&nbsp; Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But you are a stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I know you too well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You have the advantage then, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; I
am a newcomer here.&nbsp; I never have seen you before to my knowledge;
and I certainly do not, could not, hate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Are you not Monsieur B--?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He flinched.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am&mdash;in Paris,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But here I am Monsieur G--.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is trivial.&nbsp; You are the man I say you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How did you know my real name, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I saw you in years gone by, when you did not see me.&nbsp;
You were formerly Member of the Committee of Public Safety, under the
Convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You guillotined my father, my brother, my uncle&mdash;all
my family, nearly, and broke my mother&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; They had
done nothing but keep silence.&nbsp; Their sentiments were only guessed.&nbsp;
Their headless corpses were thrown indiscriminately into the ditch of
the Mousseaux Cemetery, and destroyed with lime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You left me without a friend, and here I am now, alone
in a foreign land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am sorry for you,&rdquo; said be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry
for the consequence, not for the intent.&nbsp; What I did was a matter
of conscience, and, from a point of view indiscernible by you, I did
right.&nbsp; I profited not a farthing.&nbsp; But I shall not argue
this.&nbsp; You have the satisfaction of seeing me here an exile also,
in poverty, betrayed by comrades, as friendless as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is no satisfaction to me, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, things done cannot be altered.&nbsp; Now the
question: are you quite recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not from dislike and dread of you&mdash;otherwise,
yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good morning, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did not meet again till one evening at the theatre (which
my mother&rsquo;s friend was with great difficulty induced to frequent,
to perfect herself in English pronunciation, the idea she entertained
at that time being to become a teacher of English in her own country
later on).&nbsp; She found him sitting next to her, and it made her
pale and restless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are still afraid of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am.&nbsp; O cannot you understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He signified the affirmative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I follow the play with difficulty,&rdquo; he said,
presently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;So do I&mdash;<i>now</i>,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He regarded her long, and she was conscious of his look; and
while she kept her eyes on the stage they filled with tears.&nbsp; Still
she would not move, and the tears ran visibly down her cheek, though
the play was a merry one, being no other than Mr. Sheridan&rsquo;s comedy
of &ldquo;The Rivals,&rdquo; with Mr. S. Kemble as Captain Absolute.&nbsp;
He saw her distress, and that her mind was elsewhere; and abruptly rising
from his seat at candle-snuffing time he left the theatre.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though he lived in the old town, and she in the new, they
frequently saw each other at a distance.&nbsp; One of these occasions
was when she was on the north side of the harbour, by the ferry, waiting
for the boat to take her across.&nbsp; He was standing by Cove Row,
on the quay opposite.&nbsp; Instead of entering the boat when it arrived
she stepped back from the quay; but looking to see if he remained she
beheld him pointing with his finger to the ferry-boat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Enter!&rdquo; he said, in a voice loud enough to reach
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mademoiselle V--- stood still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Enter!&rdquo; he said, and, as she did not move, he
repeated the word a third time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She had really been going to cross, and now approached and
stepped down into the boat.&nbsp; Though she did not raise her eyes
she knew that he was watching her over.&nbsp; At the landing steps she
saw from under the brim of her hat a hand stretched down.&nbsp; The
steps were steep and slippery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, Monsieur,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless,
indeed, you believe in God, and repent of your evil past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am sorry you were made to suffer.&nbsp; But I only
believe in the god called Reason, and I do not repent.&nbsp; I was the
instrument of a national principle.&nbsp; Your friends were not sacrificed
for any ends of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thereupon withheld her hand, and clambered up unassisted.&nbsp;
He went on, ascending the Look-out Hill, and disappearing over the brow.&nbsp;
Her way was in the same direction, her errand being to bring home the
two young girls under her charge, who had gone to the cliff for an airing.&nbsp;
When she joined them at the top she saw his solitary figure at the further
edge, standing motionless against the sea.&nbsp; All the while that
she remained with her pupils he stood without turning, as if looking
at the frigates in the roadstead, but more probably in meditation, unconscious
where he was.&nbsp; In leaving the spot one of the children threw away
half a sponge-biscuit that she had been eating.&nbsp; Passing near it
he stooped, picked it up carefully, and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mademoiselle V--- came homeward, asking herself, &ldquo;Can
he be starving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From that day he was invisible for so long a time that she
thought he had gone away altogether.&nbsp; But one evening a note came
to her, and she opened it trembling.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am here ill,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;and,
as you know, alone.&nbsp; There are one or two little things I want
done, in case my death should occur,&mdash;and I should prefer not to
ask the people here, if it could be avoided.&nbsp; Have you enough of
the gift of charity to come and carry out my wishes before it is too
late?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now so it was that, since seeing him possess himself of the
broken cake, she had insensibly begun to feel something that was more
than curiosity, though perhaps less than anxiety, about this fellow-countryman
of hers; and it was not in her nervous and sensitive heart to resist
his appeal.&nbsp; She found his lodging (to which he had removed from
the Old Rooms inn for economy) to be a room over a shop, half-way up
the steep and narrow street of the old town, to which the fashionable
visitors seldom penetrated.&nbsp; With some misgiving she entered the
house, and was admitted to the chamber where he lay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are too good, too good,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
And presently, &ldquo;You need not shut the door.&nbsp; You will feel
safer, and they will not understand what we say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Are you in want, Monsieur?&nbsp; Can I give you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; I merely want you to do a trifling thing
or two that I have not strength enough to do myself.&nbsp; Nobody in
the town but you knows who I really am&mdash;unless you have told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I have not told . . . I thought you <i>might</i> have
acted from principle in those sad days, even&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are kind to concede that much.&nbsp; However, to
the present.&nbsp; I was able to destroy my few papers before I became
so weak . . . But in the drawer there you will find some pieces of linen
clothing&mdash;only two or three&mdash;marked with initials that may
be recognized.&nbsp; Will you rip them out with a penknife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She searched as bidden, found the garments, cut out the stitches
of the lettering, and replaced the linen as before.&nbsp; A promise
to post, in the event of his death, a letter he put in her hand, completed
all that he required of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He thanked her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you seem sorry for me,&rdquo;
he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I am surprised.&nbsp; You are sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She evaded the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you repent and believe?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rdquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Contrary to her expectations and his own he recovered, though
very slowly; and her manner grew more distant thenceforward, though
his influence upon her was deeper than she knew.&nbsp; Weeks passed
away, and the month of May arrived.&nbsp; One day at this time she met
him walking slowly along the beach to the northward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You know the news?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You mean of the rupture between France and England
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes; and the feeling of antagonism is stronger than
it was in the last war, owing to Bonaparte&rsquo;s high-handed arrest
of the innocent English who were travelling in our country for pleasure.&nbsp;
I feel that the war will be long and bitter; and that my wish to live
unknown in England will be frustrated.&nbsp; See here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He took from his pocket a piece of the single newspaper which
circulated in the county in those days, and she read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The magistrates acting under the Alien Act have
been requested to direct a very scrutinizing eye to the Academies in
our towns and other places, in which French tutors are employed, and
to all of that nationality who profess to be teachers in this country.&nbsp;
Many of them are known to be inveterate Enemies and Traitors to the
nation among whose people they have found a livelihood and a home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He continued: &ldquo;I have observed since the declaration
of war a marked difference in the conduct of the rougher class of people
here towards me.&nbsp; If a great battle were to occur&mdash;as it soon
will, no doubt&mdash;feeling would grow to a pitch that would make it
impossible for me, a disguised man of no known occupation, to stay here.&nbsp;
With you, whose duties and antecedents are known, it may be less difficult,
but still unpleasant.&nbsp; Now I propose this.&nbsp; You have probably
seen how my deep sympathy with you has quickened to a warm feeling;
and what I say is, will you agree to give me a title to protect you
by honouring me with your hand?&nbsp; I am older than you, it is true,
but as husband and wife we can leave England together, and make the
whole world our country.&nbsp; Though I would propose Quebec, in Canada,
as the place which offers the best promise of a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My God!&nbsp; You surprise me!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But you accept my proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And yet I think you will, Mademoiselle, some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t distress you further now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Much thanks . . . I am glad to see you looking better,
Monsieur; I mean you are looking better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, yes.&nbsp; I am improving.&nbsp; I walk in the
sun every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And almost every day she saw him&mdash;sometimes nodding stiffly
only, sometimes exchanging formal civilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not
gone yet,&rdquo; she said on one of these occasions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No.&nbsp; At present I don&rsquo;t think of going without
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But you find it uncomfortable here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Somewhat.&nbsp; So when will you have pity on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She shook her head and went on her way.&nbsp; Yet she was
a little moved.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did it on principle,&rdquo; she would
murmur.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had no animosity towards them, and profited
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wondered how he lived.&nbsp; It was evident that he could
not be so poor as she had thought; his pretended poverty might be to
escape notice.&nbsp; She could not tell, but she knew that she was dangerously
interested in him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he still mended, till his thin, pale face became more
full and firm.&nbsp; As he mended she had to meet that request of his,
advanced with even stronger insistency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The arrival of the King and Court for the season as usual
brought matters to a climax for these two lonely exiles and fellow country-people.&nbsp;
The King&rsquo;s awkward preference for a part of the coast in such
dangerous proximity to France made it necessary that a strict military
vigilance should be exercised to guard the royal residents.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen
frigates were every night posted in a line across the bay, and two lines
of sentinels, one at the water&rsquo;s edge and another behind the Esplanade,
occupied the whole sea-front after eight every night.&nbsp; The watering-place
was growing an inconvenient residence even for Mademoiselle V--- herself,
her friendship for this strange French tutor and writing-master who
never had any pupils having been observed by many who slightly knew
her.&nbsp; The General&rsquo;s wife, whose dependent she was, repeatedly
warned her against the acquaintance; while the Hanoverian and other
soldiers of the Foreign Legion, who had discovered the nationality of
her friend, were more aggressive than the English military gallants
who made it their business to notice her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this tense state of affairs her answers became more agitated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O Heaven, how can I marry you!&rdquo; she would say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You will; surely you will!&rdquo; he answered again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t leave without you.&nbsp; And I shall soon be interrogated
before the magistrates if I stay here; probably imprisoned.&nbsp; You
will come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She felt her defences breaking down.&nbsp; Contrary to all
reason and sense of family honour she was, by some abnormal craving,
inclining to a tenderness for him that was founded on its opposite.&nbsp;
Sometimes her warm sentiments burnt lower than at others, and then the
enormity of her conduct showed itself in more staring hues.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shortly after this he came with a resigned look on his face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is as I expected,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have received
a hint to go.&nbsp; In good sooth, I am no Bonapartist&mdash;I am no
enemy to England; but the presence of the King made it impossible for
a foreigner with no visible occupation, and who may be a spy, to remain
at large in the town.&nbsp; The authorities are civil, but firm.&nbsp;
They are no more than reasonable.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I must go.&nbsp;
You must come also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did not speak.&nbsp; But she nodded assent, her eyes drooping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On her way back to the house on the Esplanade she said to
herself, &ldquo;I am glad, I am glad!&nbsp; I could not do otherwise.&nbsp;
It is rendering good for evil!&rdquo;&nbsp; But she knew how she mocked
herself in this, and that the moral principle had not operated one jot
in her acceptance of him.&nbsp; In truth she had not realized till now
the full presence of the emotion which had unconsciously grown up in
her for this lonely and severe man, who, in her tradition, was vengeance
and irreligion personified.&nbsp; He seemed to absorb her whole nature,
and, absorbing, to control it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A day or two before the one fixed for the wedding there chanced
to come to her a letter from the only acquaintance of her own sex and
country she possessed in England, one to whom she had sent intelligence
of her approaching marriage, without mentioning with whom.&nbsp; This
friend&rsquo;s misfortunes had been somewhat similar to her own, which
fact had been one cause of their intimacy; her friend&rsquo;s sister,
a nun of the Abbey of Montmartre, having perished on the scaffold at
the hands of the same Comit&eacute; de Salut Public which had numbered
Mademoiselle V--&rsquo;s affianced among its members.&nbsp; The writer
had felt her position much again of late, since the renewal of the war,
she said; and the letter wound up with a fresh denunciation of the authors
of their mutual bereavement and subsequent troubles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming just then, its contents produced upon Mademoiselle
V--- the effect of a pail of water upon a somnambulist.&nbsp; What had
she been doing in betrothing herself to this man!&nbsp; Was she not
making herself a parricide after the event?&nbsp; At this crisis in
her feelings her lover called.&nbsp; He beheld her trembling, and, in
reply to his question, she told him of her scruples with impulsive candour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She had not intended to do this, but his attitude of tender
command coerced her into frankness.&nbsp; Thereupon he exhibited an
agitation never before apparent in him.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;But all
that is past.&nbsp; You are the symbol of Charity, and we are pledged
to let bygones be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His words soothed her for the moment, but she was sadly silent,
and he went away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That night she saw (as she firmly believed to the end of her
life) a divinely sent vision.&nbsp; A procession of her lost relatives&mdash;father,
brother, uncle, cousin&mdash;seemed to cross her chamber between her
bed and the window, and when she endeavoured to trace their features
she perceived them to be headless, and that she had recognized them
by their familiar clothes only.&nbsp; In the morning she could not shake
off the effects of this appearance on her nerves.&nbsp; All that day
she saw nothing of her wooer, he being occupied in making arrangements
for their departure.&nbsp; It grew towards evening&mdash;the marriage
eve; but, in spite of his re-assuring visit, her sense of family duty
waxed stronger now that she was left alone.&nbsp; Yet, she asked herself,
how could she, alone and unprotected, go at this eleventh hour and reassert
to an affianced husband that she could not and would not marry him while
admitting at the same time that she loved him?&nbsp; The situation dismayed
her.&nbsp; She had relinquished her post as governess, and was staying
temporarily in a room near the coach-office, where she expected him
to call in the morning to carry out the business of their union and
departure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wisely or foolishly, Mademoiselle V--- came to a resolution:
that her only safety lay in flight.&nbsp; His contiguity influenced
her too sensibly; she could not reason.&nbsp; So packing up her few
possessions and placing on the table the small sum she owed, she went
out privately, secured a last available seat in the London coach, and,
almost before she had fully weighed her action, she was rolling out
of the town in the dusk of the September evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having taken this startling step she began to reflect upon
her reasons.&nbsp; He had been one of that tragic Committee the sound
of whose name was a horror to the civilized world; yet he had been only
one of several members, and, it seemed, not the most active.&nbsp; He
had marked down names on principle, had felt no personal enmity against
his victims, and had enriched himself not a sou out of the office he
had held.&nbsp; Nothing could change the past.&nbsp; Meanwhile he loved
her, and her heart inclined to as much of him as she could detach from
that past.&nbsp; Why not, as he had suggested, bury memories, and inaugurate
a new era by this union?&nbsp; In other words, why not indulge her tenderness,
since its nullification could do no good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus she held self-communion in her seat in the coach, passing
through Casterbridge, and Shottsford, and on to the White Hart at Melchester,
at which place the whole fabric of her recent intentions crumbled down.&nbsp;
Better be staunch having got so far; let things take their course, and
marry boldly the man who had so impressed her.&nbsp; How great he was;
how small was she!&nbsp; And she had presumed to judge him!&nbsp; Abandoning
her place in the coach with the precipitancy that had characterized
her taking it, she waited till the vehicle had driven off, something
in the departing shapes of the outside passengers against the starlit
sky giving her a start, as she afterwards remembered.&nbsp; Presently
the down coach, &ldquo;The Morning Herald,&rdquo; entered the city,
and she hastily obtained a place on the top.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be firm&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be his&mdash;if
it cost me my immortal soul!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And with troubled
breathings she journeyed back over the road she had just traced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She reached our royal watering-place by the time the day broke,
and her first aim was to get back to the hired room in which her last
few days had been spent.&nbsp; When the landlady appeared at the door
in response to Mademoiselle V--&rsquo;s nervous summons, she explained
her sudden departure and return as best she could; and no objection
being offered to her re-engagement of the room for one day longer she
ascended to the chamber and sat down panting.&nbsp; She was back once
more, and her wild tergiversations were a secret from him whom alone
they concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sealed letter was on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
it is directed to you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the woman who had followed
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we were wondering what to do with it.&nbsp; A
town messenger brought it after you had gone last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the landlady had left, Mademoiselle V--- opened the letter
and read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIEND.&mdash;You have been
throughout our acquaintance absolutely candid concerning your misgivings.&nbsp;
But I have been reserved concerning mine.&nbsp; That is the difference
between us.&nbsp; You probably have not guessed that every qualm you
have felt on the subject of our marriage has been paralleled in my heart
to the full.&nbsp; Thus it happened that your involuntary outburst of
remorse yesterday, though mechanically deprecated by me in your presence,
was a last item in my own doubts on the wisdom of our union, giving
them a force that I could no longer withstand.&nbsp; I came home; and,
on reflection, much as I honour and adore you, I decide to set you free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As one whose life has been devoted, and I may say sacrificed,
to the cause of Liberty, I cannot allow your judgment (probably a permanent
one) to be fettered beyond release by a feeling which may be transient
only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be no less than excruciating to both that I should
announce this decision to you by word of mouth.&nbsp; I have therefore
taken the less painful course of writing.&nbsp; Before you receive this
I shall have left the town by the evening coach for London, on reaching
which city my movements will be revealed to none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regard me, Mademoiselle, as dead, and accept my renewed assurances
of respect, remembrance, and affection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;When she had recovered from her shock of surprise and grief,
she remembered that at the starting of the coach out of Melchester before
dawn, the shape of a figure among the outside passengers against the
starlit sky had caused her a momentary start, from its resemblance to
that of her friend.&nbsp; Knowing nothing of each other&rsquo;s intentions,
and screened from each other by the darkness, they had left the town
by the same conveyance.&nbsp; &ldquo;He, the greater, persevered; I,
the smaller, returned!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Recovering from her stupor, Mademoiselle V--- bethought herself
again of her employer, Mrs. Newbold, whom recent events had estranged.&nbsp;
To that lady she went with a full heart, and explained everything.&nbsp;
Mrs. Newbold kept to herself her opinion of the episode, and reinstalled
the deserted bride in her old position as governess to the family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A governess she remained to the end of her days.&nbsp; After
the final peace with France she became acquainted with my mother, to
whom by degrees she imparted these experiences of hers.&nbsp; As her
hair grew white, and her features pinched, Mademoiselle V--- would wonder
what nook of the world contained her lover, if he lived, and if by any
chance she might see him again.&nbsp; But when, some time in the &rsquo;twenties,
death came to her, at no great age, that outline against the stars of
the morning remained as the last glimpse she ever obtained of her family&rsquo;s
foe and her once affianced husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>1895.</p>
<h2>MASTER JOHN HORSELEIGH, KNIGHT</h2>
<p>In the earliest and mustiest volume of the Havenpool marriage registers
(said the thin-faced gentleman) this entry may still be read by any
one curious enough to decipher the crabbed handwriting of the date.&nbsp;
I took a copy of it when I was last there; and it runs thus (he had
opened his pocket-book, and now read aloud the extract; afterwards handing
round the book to us, wherein we saw transcribed the following)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mastr John Horseleigh, Knyght, of the p&rsquo;ysshe of
Clyffton was maryd to Edith the wyffe late off John Stocker, m&rsquo;chawnte
of Havenpool the xiiij daje of December be p&rsquo;vylegge gevyn by
our sup&rsquo;me hedd of the chyrche of Ingelonde Kynge Henry the viii
th 1539.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if you turn to the long and elaborate pedigree of the ancient
family of the Horseleighs of Clyfton Horseleigh, you will find no mention
whatever of this alliance, notwithstanding the privilege given by the
Sovereign and head of the Church; the said Sir John being therein chronicled
as marrying, at a date apparently earlier than the above, the daughter
and heiress of Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether Wessex, a
lady who outlived him, of which marriage there were issue two daughters
and a son, who succeeded him in his estates.&nbsp; How are we to account
for these, as it would seem, contemporaneous wives?&nbsp; A strange
local tradition only can help us, and this can be briefly told.</p>
<p>One evening in the autumn of the year 1540 or 1541, a young sailor,
whose Christian name was Roger, but whose surname is not known, landed
at his native place of Havenpool, on the South Wessex coast, after a
voyage in the Newfoundland trade, then newly sprung into existence.&nbsp;
He returned in the ship <i>Primrose</i> with a cargo of &lsquo;trayne
oyle brought home from the New Founde Lande,&rsquo; to quote from the
town records of the date.&nbsp; During his absence of two summers and
a winter, which made up the term of a Newfoundland &lsquo;spell,&rsquo;
many unlooked-for changes had occurred within the quiet little seaport,
some of which closely affected Roger the sailor.&nbsp; At the time of
his departure his only sister Edith had become the bride of one Stocker,
a respectable townsman, and part owner of the brig in which Roger had
sailed; and it was to the house of this couple, his only relatives,
that the young man directed his steps.&nbsp; On trying the door in Quay
Street he found it locked, and then observed that the windows were boarded
up.&nbsp; Inquiring of a bystander, he learnt for the first time of
the death of his brother-in-law, though that event had taken place nearly
eighteen months before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my sister Edith?&rsquo; asked Roger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s married again&mdash;as they do say, and hath been
so these twelve months.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t vouch for the truth o&rsquo;t,
though if she isn&rsquo;t she ought to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roger&rsquo;s face grew dark.&nbsp; He was a man with a considerable
reserve of strong passion, and he asked his informant what he meant
by speaking thus.</p>
<p>The man explained that shortly after the young woman&rsquo;s bereavement
a stranger had come to the port.&nbsp; He had seen her moping on the
quay, had been attracted by her youth and loneliness, and in an extraordinarily
brief wooing had completely fascinated her&mdash;had carried her off,
and, as was reported, had married her.&nbsp; Though he had come by water,
he was supposed to live no very great distance off by land.&nbsp; They
were last heard of at Oozewood, in Upper Wessex, at the house of one
Wall, a timber-merchant, where, he believed, she still had a lodging,
though her husband, if he were lawfully that much, was but an occasional
visitor to the place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The stranger?&rsquo; asked Roger.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you see
him?&nbsp; What manner of man was he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I liked him not,&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;He seemed
of that kind that hath something to conceal, and as he walked with her
he ever and anon turned his head and gazed behind him, as if he much
feared an unwelcome pursuer.&nbsp; But, faith,&rsquo; continued he,
&lsquo;it may have been the man&rsquo;s anxiety only.&nbsp; Yet did
I not like him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he older than my sister?&rsquo; Roger asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&mdash;much older; from a dozen to a score of years older.&nbsp;
A man of some position, maybe, playing an amorous game for the pleasure
of the hour.&nbsp; Who knoweth but that he have a wife already?&nbsp;
Many have done the thing hereabouts of late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having paid a visit to the graves of his relatives, the sailor next
day went along the straight road which, then a lane, now a highway,
conducted to the curious little inland town named by the Havenpool man.&nbsp;
It is unnecessary to describe Oozewood on the South-Avon.&nbsp; It has
a railway at the present day; but thirty years of steam traffic past
its precincts have hardly modified its original features.&nbsp; Surrounded
by a sort of fresh-water lagoon, dividing it from meadows and coppice,
its ancient thatch and timber houses have barely made way even in the
front street for the ubiquitous modern brick and slate.&nbsp; It neither
increases nor diminishes in size; it is difficult to say what the inhabitants
find to do, for, though trades in woodware are still carried on, there
cannot be enough of this class of work nowadays to maintain all the
householders, the forests around having been so greatly thinned and
curtailed.&nbsp; At the time of this tradition the forests were dense,
artificers in wood abounded, and the timber trade was brisk.&nbsp; Every
house in the town, without exception, was of oak framework, filled in
with plaster, and covered with thatch, the chimney being the only brick
portion of the structure.&nbsp; Inquiry soon brought Roger the sailor
to the door of Wall, the timber-dealer referred to, but it was some
time before he was able to gain admission to the lodging of his sister,
the people having plainly received directions not to welcome strangers.</p>
<p>She was sitting in an upper room on one of the lath-backed, willow-bottomed
&lsquo;shepherd&rsquo;s&rsquo; chairs, made on the spot then as to this
day, and as they were probably made there in the days of the Heptarchy.&nbsp;
In her lap was an infant, which she had been suckling, though now it
had fallen asleep; so had the young mother herself for a few minutes,
under the drowsing effects of solitude.&nbsp; Hearing footsteps on the
stairs, she awoke, started up with a glad cry, and ran to the door,
opening which she met her brother on the threshold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, this is merry; I didn&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;ee!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, Roger&mdash;I thought it was John.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Her tones fell to disappointment.</p>
<p>The sailor kissed her, looked at her sternly for a few moments, and
pointing to the infant, said, &lsquo;You mean the father of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my husband,&rsquo; said Edith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Roger, I&rsquo;m married&mdash;of a truth am I!&rsquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shame upon &rsquo;ee, if true!&nbsp; If not true, worse.&nbsp;
Master Stocker was an honest man, and ye should have respected his memory
longer.&nbsp; Where is thy husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He comes often.&nbsp; I thought it was he now.&nbsp; Our marriage
has to be kept secret for a while&mdash;it was done privily for certain
reasons; but we was married at church like honest folk&mdash;afore God
we were, Roger, six months after poor Stocker&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas too soon,&rsquo; said Roger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was living in a house alone; I had nowhere to go to.&nbsp;
You were far over sea in the New Found Land, and John took me and brought
me here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How often doth he come?&rsquo; says Roger again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once or twice weekly,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish th&rsquo; &lsquo;dst waited till I returned, dear Edy,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It mid be you are a wife&mdash;I hope so.&nbsp;
But, if so, why this mystery?&nbsp; Why this mean and cramped lodging
in this lonely copse-circled town?&nbsp; Of what standing is your husband,
and of where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is of gentle breeding&mdash;his name is John.&nbsp; I am
not free to tell his family-name.&nbsp; He is said to be of London,
for safety&rsquo; sake; but he really lives in the county next adjoining
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where in the next county?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know.&nbsp; He has preferred not to tell me, that
I may not have the secret forced from me, to his and my hurt, by bringing
the marriage to the ears of his kinsfolk and friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her brother&rsquo;s face flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our people have been
honest townsmen, well-reputed for long; why should you readily take
such humbling from a sojourner of whom th&rsquo; &lsquo;st know nothing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They remained in constrained converse till her quick ear caught a
sound, for which she might have been waiting&mdash;a horse&rsquo;s footfall.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is John!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is his night&mdash;Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened lest he should find me here!&rsquo;
said Roger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am on the point of leaving.&nbsp; I wish
not to be a third party.&nbsp; Say nothing at all about my visit, if
it will incommode you so to do.&nbsp; I will see thee before I go afloat
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking thus he left the room, and descending the staircase let
himself out by the front door, thinking he might obtain a glimpse of
the approaching horseman.&nbsp; But that traveller had in the meantime
gone stealthily round to the back of the homestead, and peering along
the pinion-end of the house Roger discerned him unbridling and haltering
his horse with his own hands in the shed there.</p>
<p>Roger retired to the neighbouring inn called the Black Lamb, and
meditated.&nbsp; This mysterious method of approach determined him,
after all, not to leave the place till he had ascertained more definite
facts of his sister&rsquo;s position&mdash;whether she were the deluded
victim of the stranger or the wife she obviously believed herself to
be.&nbsp; Having eaten some supper, he left the inn, it being now about
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He first looked into the shed, and, finding
the horse still standing there, waited irresolutely near the door of
his sister&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; Half an hour elapsed, and, while thinking
he would climb into a loft hard by for a night&rsquo;s rest, there seemed
to be a movement within the shutters of the sitting-room that his sister
occupied.&nbsp; Roger hid himself behind a faggot-stack near the back
door, rightly divining that his sister&rsquo;s visitor would emerge
by the way he had entered.&nbsp; The door opened, and the candle she
held in her hand lighted for a moment the stranger&rsquo;s form, showing
it to be that of a tall and handsome personage, about forty years of
age, and apparently of a superior position in life.&nbsp; Edith was
assisting him to cloak himself, which being done he took leave of her
with a kiss and left the house.&nbsp; From the door she watched him
bridle and saddle his horse, and having mounted and waved an adieu to
her as she stood candle in hand, he turned out of the yard and rode
away.</p>
<p>The horse which bore him was, or seemed to be, a little lame, and
Roger fancied from this that the rider&rsquo;s journey was not likely
to be a long one.&nbsp; Being light of foot he followed apace, having
no great difficulty on such a still night in keeping within earshot
some few miles, the horseman pausing more than once.&nbsp; In this pursuit
Roger discovered the rider to choose bridle-tracks and open commons
in preference to any high road.&nbsp; The distance soon began to prove
a more trying one than he had bargained for; and when out of breath
and in some despair of being able to ascertain the man&rsquo;s identity,
he perceived an ass standing in the starlight under a hayrick, from
which the animal was helping itself to periodic mouthfuls.</p>
<p>The story goes that Roger caught the ass, mounted, and again resumed
the trail of the unconscious horseman, which feat may have been possible
to a nautical young fellow, though one can hardly understand how a sailor
would ride such an animal without bridle or saddle, and strange to his
hands, unless the creature were extraordinarily docile.&nbsp; This question,
however, is immaterial.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that at dawn the following
morning Roger beheld his sister&rsquo;s lover or husband entering the
gates of a large and well-timbered park on the south-western verge of
the White Hart Forest (as it was then called), now known to everybody
as the Vale of Blackmoor.&nbsp; Thereupon the sailor discarded his steed,
and finding for himself an obscurer entrance to the same park a little
further on, he crossed the grass to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>He presently perceived amid the trees before him a mansion which,
new to himself, was one of the best known in the county at that time.&nbsp;
Of this fine manorial residence hardly a trace now remains; but a manuscript
dated some years later than the events we are regarding describes it
in terms from which the imagination may construct a singularly clear
and vivid picture.&nbsp; This record presents it as consisting of &lsquo;a
faire yellow freestone building, partly two and partly three storeys;
a faire halle and parlour, both waynscotted; a faire dyning roome and
withdrawing roome, and many good lodgings; a kitchen adjoyninge backwarde
to one end of the dwelling-house, with a faire passage from it into
the halle, parlour, and dyninge roome, and sellars adjoyninge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the front of the house a square greene court, and a curious
gatehouse with lodgings in it, standing with the front of the house
to the south; in a large outer court three stables, a coach-house, a
large barne, and a stable for oxen and kyne, and all houses necessary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without the gatehouse, paled in, a large square greene, in
which standeth a faire chappell; of the south-east side of the greene
court, towards the river, a large garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of the south-west side of the greene court is a large bowling
greene, with fower mounted walks about it, all walled about with a batteled
wall, and sett with all sorts of fruit; and out of it into the feildes
there are large walks under many tall elmes orderly planted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then follows a description of the orchards and gardens; the servants&rsquo;
offices, brewhouse, bakehouse, dairy, pigeon-houses, and corn-mill;
the river and its abundance of fish; the warren, the coppices, the walks;
ending thus&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And all the country north of the house, open champaign, sandy
feildes, very dry and pleasant for all kindes of recreation, huntinge,
and hawkinge, and profitble for tillage . . . The house hath a large
prospect east, south, and west, over a very large and pleasant vale
. . . is seated from the good markett towns of Sherton Abbas three miles,
and Ivel a mile, that plentifully yield all manner of provision; and
within twelve miles of the south sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was on the grass before this seductive and picturesque structure
that the sailor stood at gaze under the elms in the dim dawn of Sunday
morning, and saw to his surprise his sister&rsquo;s lover and horse
vanish within the court of the building.</p>
<p>Perplexed and weary, Roger slowly retreated, more than ever convinced
that something was wrong in his sister&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; He crossed
the bowling green to the avenue of elms, and, bent on further research,
was about to climb into one of these, when, looking below, he saw a
heap of hay apparently for horses or deer.&nbsp; Into this he crept,
and, having eaten a crust of bread which he had hastily thrust into
his pocket at the inn, he curled up and fell asleep, the hay forming
a comfortable bed, and quite covering him over.</p>
<p>He slept soundly and long, and was awakened by the sound of a bell.&nbsp;
On peering from the hay he found the time had advanced to full day;
the sun was shining brightly.&nbsp; The bell was that of the &lsquo;faire
chappell&rsquo; on the green outside the gatehouse, and it was calling
to matins.&nbsp; Presently the priest crossed the green to a little
side-door in the chancel, and then from the gateway of the mansion emerged
the household, the tall man whom Roger had seen with his sister on the
previous night, on his arm being a portly dame, and, running beside
the pair, two little girls and a boy.&nbsp; These all entered the chapel,
and the bell having ceased and the environs become clear, the sailor
crept out from his hiding.</p>
<p>He sauntered towards the chapel, the opening words of the service
being audible within.&nbsp; While standing by the porch he saw a belated
servitor approaching from the kitchen-court to attend the service also.&nbsp;
Roger carelessly accosted him, and asked, as an idle wanderer, the name
of the family he had just seen cross over from the mansion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Od zounds! if ye modden be a stranger here in very truth,
goodman.&nbsp; That wer Sir John and his dame, and his children Elizabeth,
Mary, and John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be from foreign parts.&nbsp; Sir John what d&rsquo;ye call&rsquo;n?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master John Horseleigh, Knight, who had a&rsquo;most as much
lond by inheritance of his mother as &lsquo;a had by his father, and
likewise some by his wife.&nbsp; Why, bain&rsquo;t his arms dree goolden
horses&rsquo; heads, and idden his lady the daughter of Master Richard
Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether Wessex, known to us all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It mid be so, and yet it mid not.&nbsp; However, th&rsquo;
&lsquo;lt miss thy prayers for such an honest knight&rsquo;s welfare,
and I have to traipse seaward many miles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went onward, and as he walked continued saying to himself, &lsquo;Now
to that poor wronged fool Edy.&nbsp; The fond thing!&nbsp; I thought
it; &rsquo;twas too quick&mdash;she was ever amorous.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
to become of her!&nbsp; God wot!&nbsp; How be I going to face her with
the news, and how be I to hold it from her?&nbsp; To bring this disgrace
on my father&rsquo;s honoured name, a double-tongued knave!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He turned and shook his fist at the chapel and all in it, and resumed
his way.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was owing to the perplexity of his mind that, instead
of returning by the direct road towards his sister&rsquo;s obscure lodging
in the next county, he followed the highway to Casterbridge, some fifteen
miles off, where he remained drinking hard all that afternoon and evening,
and where he lay that and two or three succeeding nights, wandering
thence along the Anglebury road to some village that way, and lying
the Friday night after at his native place of Havenpool.&nbsp; The sight
of the familiar objects there seems to have stirred him anew to action,
and the next morning he was observed pursuing the way to Oozewood that
he had followed on the Saturday previous, reckoning, no doubt, that
Saturday night would, as before, be a time for finding Sir John with
his sister again.</p>
<p>He delayed to reach the place till just before sunset.&nbsp; His
sister was walking in the meadows at the foot of the garden, with a
nursemaid who carried the baby, and she looked up pensively when he
approached.&nbsp; Anxiety as to her position had already told upon her
once rosy cheeks and lucid eyes.&nbsp; But concern for herself and child
was displaced for the moment by her regard of Roger&rsquo;s worn and
haggard face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;you are sick, Roger&mdash;you are tired!&nbsp; Where
have you been these many days?&nbsp; Why not keep me company a bit&mdash;my
husband is much away?&nbsp; And we have hardly spoke at all of dear
father and of your voyage to the New Land.&nbsp; Why did you go away
so suddenly?&nbsp; There is a spare chamber at my lodging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come indoors,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll talk
now&mdash;talk a good deal.&nbsp; As for him [nodding to the child],
better heave him into the river; better for him and you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She forced a laugh, as if she tried to see a good joke in the remark,
and they went silently indoors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A miserable hole!&rsquo; said Roger, looking round the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but &rsquo;tis very pretty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not after what I&rsquo;ve seen.&nbsp; Did he marry &rsquo;ee
at church in orderly fashion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did sure&mdash;at our church at Havenpool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in a privy way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&mdash;because of his friends&mdash;it was at night-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ede, ye fond one&mdash;for all that he&rsquo;s not thy husband!&nbsp;
Th&rsquo; &lsquo;rt not his wife; and the child is a bastard.&nbsp;
He hath a wife and children of his own rank, and bearing his name; and
that&rsquo;s Sir John Horseleigh, of Clyfton Horseleigh, and not plain
Jack, as you think him, and your lawful husband.&nbsp; The sacrament
of marriage is no safeguard nowadays.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s new-made
headship of the Church hath led men to practise these tricks lightly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had turned white.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not true, Roger!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are in liquor, my brother, and you know not
what you say!&nbsp; Your seafaring years have taught &rsquo;ee bad things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Edith&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen them; wife and family&mdash;all.&nbsp;
How canst&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting in the gathered darkness, and at that moment steps
were heard without.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go out this way,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is my husband.&nbsp; He must not see thee in this mood.&nbsp;
Get away till to-morrow, Roger, as you care for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pushed her brother through a door leading to the back stairs,
and almost as soon as it was closed her visitor entered.&nbsp; Roger,
however, did not retreat down the stairs; he stood and looked through
the bobbin-hole.&nbsp; If the visitor turned out to be Sir John, he
had determined to confront him.</p>
<p>It was the knight.&nbsp; She had struck a light on his entry, and
he kissed the child, and took Edith tenderly by the shoulders, looking
into her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something&rsquo;s gone awry wi&rsquo; my dear!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Jack!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have heard such
a fearsome rumour&mdash;what doth it mean?&nbsp; He who told me is my
best friend.&nbsp; He must be deceived!&nbsp; But who deceived him,
and why?&nbsp; Jack, I was just told that you had a wife living when
you married me, and have her still!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wife?&mdash;H&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and children.&nbsp; Say no, say no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By God!&nbsp; I have no lawful wife but you; and as for children,
many or few, they are all bastards, save this one alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that you be Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mid be.&nbsp; I have never said so to &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Sir John is known to have a lady, and issue of her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The knight looked down.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did thy mind get filled
with such as this?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of my kindred came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A traitor!&nbsp; Why should he mar our life?&nbsp; Ah! you
said you had a brother at sea&mdash;where is he now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here!&rsquo; came from close behind him.&nbsp; And flinging
open the door, Roger faced the intruder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Liar!&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;to call thyself her husband!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir John fired up, and made a rush at the sailor, who seized him
by the collar, and in the wrestle they both fell, Roger under.&nbsp;
But in a few seconds he contrived to extricate his right arm, and drawing
from his belt a knife which he wore attached to a cord round his neck
he opened it with his teeth, and struck it into the breast of Sir John
stretched above him.&nbsp; Edith had during these moments run into the
next room to place the child in safety, and when she came back the knight
was relaxing his hold on Roger&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; He rolled over
upon his back and groaned.</p>
<p>The only witness of the scene save the three concerned was the nursemaid,
who had brought in the child on its father&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; She
stated afterwards that nobody suspected Sir John had received his death
wound; yet it was so, though he did not die for a long while, meaning
thereby an hour or two; that Mistress Edith continually endeavoured
to staunch the blood, calling her brother Roger a wretch, and ordering
him to get himself gone; on which order he acted, after a gloomy pause,
by opening the window, and letting himself down by the sill to the ground.</p>
<p>It was then that Sir John, in difficult accents, made his dying declaration
to the nurse and Edith, and, later, the apothecary; which was to this
purport, that the Dame Horseleigh who passed as his wife at Clyfton,
and who had borne him three children, was in truth and deed, though
unconsciously, the wife of another man.&nbsp; Sir John had married her
several years before, in the face of the whole county, as the widow
of one Decimus Strong, who had disappeared shortly after her union with
him, having adventured to the North to join the revolt of the Nobles,
and on that revolt being quelled retreated across the sea.&nbsp; Two
years ago, having discovered this man to be still living in France,
and not wishing to disturb the mind and happiness of her who believed
herself his wife, yet wishing for legitimate issue, Sir John had informed
the King of the facts, who had encouraged him to wed honestly, though
secretly, the young merchant&rsquo;s widow at Havenpool; she being,
therefore, his lawful wife, and she only.&nbsp; That to avoid all scandal
and hubbub he had purposed to let things remain as they were till fair
opportunity should arise of making the true case known with least pain
to all parties concerned, but that, having been thus suspected and attacked
by his own brother-in-law, his zest for such schemes and for all things
had died out in him, and he only wished to commend his soul to God.</p>
<p>That night, while the owls were hooting from the forest that encircled
the sleeping townlet, and the South-Avon was gurgling through the wooden
piles of the bridge, Sir John died there in the arms of his wife.&nbsp;
She concealed nothing of the cause of her husband&rsquo;s death save
the subject of the quarrel, which she felt it would be premature to
announce just then, and until proof of her status should be forthcoming.&nbsp;
But before a month had passed, it happened, to her inexpressible sorrow,
that the child of this clandestine union fell sick and died.&nbsp; From
that hour all interest in the name and fame of the Horseleighs forsook
the younger of the twain who called themselves wives of Sir John, and,
being careless about her own fame, she took no steps to assert her claims,
her legal position having, indeed, grown hateful to her in her horror
at the tragedy.&nbsp; And Sir William Byrt, the curate who had married
her to her husband, being an old man and feeble, was not disinclined
to leave the embers unstirred of such a fiery matter as this, and to
assist her in letting established things stand.&nbsp; Therefore, Edith
retired with the nurse, her only companion and friend, to her native
town, where she lived in absolute obscurity till her death in middle
age.&nbsp; Her brother was never seen again in England.</p>
<p>A strangely corroborative sequel to the story remains to be told.&nbsp;
Shortly after the death of Sir John Horseleigh, a soldier of fortune
returned from the Continent, called on Dame Horseleigh the fictitious,
living in widowed state at Clyfton Horseleigh, and, after a singularly
brief courtship, married her.&nbsp; The tradition at Havenpool and elsewhere
has ever been that this man was already her husband, Decimus Strong,
who remarried her for appearance&rsquo; sake only.</p>
<p>The illegitimate son of this lady by Sir John succeeded to the estates
and honours, and his son after him, there being nobody on the alert
to investigate their pretensions.&nbsp; Little difference would it have
made to the present generation, however, had there been such a one,
for the family in all its branches, lawful and unlawful, has been extinct
these many score years, the last representative but one being killed
at the siege of Sherton Castle, while attacking in the service of the
Parliament, and the other being outlawed later in the same century for
a debt of ten pounds, and dying in the county jail.&nbsp; The mansion
house and its appurtenances were, as I have previously stated, destroyed,
excepting one small wing, which now forms part of a farmhouse, and is
visible as you pass along the railway from Casterbridge to Ivel.&nbsp;
The outline of the old bowling-green is also distinctly to be seen.</p>
<p>This, then, is the reason why the only lawful marriage of Sir John,
as recorded in the obscure register at Havenpool, does not appear in
the pedigree of the house of Horseleigh.</p>
<p><i>Spring</i> 1893.</p>
<h2>THE DUKE&rsquo;S REAPPEARANCE&mdash;A FAMILY TRADITION</h2>
<p>According to the kinsman who told me the story, Christopher Swetman&rsquo;s
house, on the outskirts of King&rsquo;s-Hintock village, was in those
days larger and better kept than when, many years later, it was sold
to the lord of the manor adjoining; after having been in the Swetman
family, as one may say, since the Conquest.</p>
<p>Some people would have it to be that the thing happened at the house
opposite, belonging to one Childs, with whose family the Swetmans afterwards
intermarried.&nbsp; But that it was at the original homestead of the
Swetmans can be shown in various ways; chiefly by the unbroken traditions
of the family, and indirectly by the evidence of the walls themselves,
which are the only ones thereabout with windows mullioned in the Elizabethan
manner, and plainly of a date anterior to the event; while those of
the other house might well have been erected fifty or eighty years later,
and probably were; since the choice of Swetman&rsquo;s house by the
fugitive was doubtless dictated by no other circumstance than its then
suitable loneliness.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy July morning just before dawn, the hour of two having
been struck by Swetman&rsquo;s one-handed clock on the stairs, that
is still preserved in the family.&nbsp; Christopher heard the strokes
from his chamber, immediately at the top of the staircase, and overlooking
the front of the house.&nbsp; He did not wonder that he was sleepless.&nbsp;
The rumours and excitements which had latterly stirred the neighbourhood,
to the effect that the rightful King of England had landed from Holland,
at a port only eighteen miles to the south-west of Swetman&rsquo;s house,
were enough to make wakeful and anxious even a contented yeoman like
him.&nbsp; Some of the villagers, intoxicated by the news, had thrown
down their scythes, and rushed to the ranks of the invader.&nbsp; Christopher
Swetman had weighed both sides of the question, and had remained at
home.</p>
<p>Now as he lay thinking of these and other things he fancied that
he could hear the footfall of a man on the road leading up to his house&mdash;a
byway, which led scarce anywhere else; and therefore a tread was at
any time more apt to startle the inmates of the homestead than if it
had stood in a thoroughfare.&nbsp; The footfall came opposite the gate,
and stopped there.&nbsp; One minute, two minutes passed, and the pedestrian
did not proceed.&nbsp; Christopher Swetman got out of bed, and opened
the casement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hoi! who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; cries he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A friend,&rsquo; came from the darkness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what mid ye want at this time o&rsquo; night?&rsquo; says
Swetman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shelter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s thy name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There came no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be ye one of King Monmouth&rsquo;s men?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He that asks no questions will hear no lies from me.&nbsp;
I am a stranger; and I am spent, and hungered.&nbsp; Can you let me
lie with you to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swetman was generous to people in trouble, and his house was roomy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll come down and
have a look at thee, anyhow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He struck a light, put on his clothes, and descended, taking his
horn-lantern from a nail in the passage, and lighting it before opening
the door.&nbsp; The rays fell on the form of a tall, dark man in cavalry
accoutrements and wearing a sword.&nbsp; He was pale with fatigue and
covered with mud, though the weather was dry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prithee take no heed of my appearance,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But let me in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That his visitor was in sore distress admitted of no doubt, and the
yeoman&rsquo;s natural humanity assisted the other&rsquo;s sad importunity
and gentle voice.&nbsp; Swetman took him in, not without a suspicion
that this man represented in some way Monmouth&rsquo;s cause, to which
he was not unfriendly in his secret heart.&nbsp; At his earnest request
the new-comer was given a suit of the yeoman&rsquo;s old clothes in
exchange for his own, which, with his sword, were hidden in a closet
in Swetman&rsquo;s chamber; food was then put before him and a lodging
provided for him in a room at the back.</p>
<p>Here he slept till quite late in the morning, which was Sunday, the
sixth of July, and when he came down in the garments that he had borrowed
he met the household with a melancholy smile.&nbsp; Besides Swetman
himself, there were only his two daughters, Grace and Leonard (the latter
was, oddly enough, a woman&rsquo;s name here), and both had been enjoined
to secrecy.&nbsp; They asked no questions and received no information;
though the stranger regarded their fair countenances with an interest
almost too deep.&nbsp; Having partaken of their usual breakfast of ham
and cider he professed weariness and retired to the chamber whence he
had come.</p>
<p>In a couple of hours or thereabout he came down again, the two young
women having now gone off to morning service.&nbsp; Seeing Christopher
bustling about the house without assistance, he asked if he could do
anything to aid his host.</p>
<p>As he seemed anxious to hide all differences and appear as one of
themselves, Swetman set him to get vegetables from the garden and fetch
water from Buttock&rsquo;s Spring in the dip near the house (though
the spring was not called by that name till years after, by the way).</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what can I do next?&rsquo; says the stranger when these
services had been performed.</p>
<p>His meekness and docility struck Christopher much, and won upon him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Since you be minded to,&rsquo; says the latter, &lsquo;you can
take down the dishes and spread the table for dinner.&nbsp; Take a pewter
plate for thyself, but the trenchers will do for we.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the other would not, and took a trencher likewise, in doing which
he spoke of the two girls and remarked how comely they were.</p>
<p>This quietude was put an end to by a stir out of doors, which was
sufficient to draw Swetman&rsquo;s attention to it, and he went out.&nbsp;
Farm hands who had gone off and joined the Duke on his arrival had begun
to come in with news that a midnight battle had been fought on the moors
to the north, the Duke&rsquo;s men, who had attacked, being entirely
worsted; the Duke himself, with one or two lords and other friends,
had fled, no one knew whither.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There has been a battle,&rsquo; says Swetman, on coming indoors
after these tidings, and looking earnestly at the stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May the victory be to the rightful in the end, whatever the
issue now,&rsquo; says the other, with a sorrowful sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dost really know nothing about it?&rsquo; said Christopher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I could have sworn you was one from that very battle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was here before three o&rsquo; the clock this morning; and
these men have only arrived now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said the yeoman.&nbsp; &lsquo;But still, I think&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not press your question,&rsquo; the stranger urged.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am in a strait, and can refuse a helper nothing; such inquiry
is, therefore, unfair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True again,&rsquo; said Swetman, and held his tongue.</p>
<p>The daughters of the house returned from church, where the service
had been hurried by reason of the excitement.&nbsp; To their father&rsquo;s
questioning if they had spoken of him who sojourned there they replied
that they had said never a word; which, indeed, was true, as events
proved.</p>
<p>He bade them serve the dinner; and, as the visitor had withdrawn
since the news of the battle, prepared to take a platter to him upstairs.&nbsp;
But he preferred to come down and dine with the family.</p>
<p>During the afternoon more fugitives passed through the village, but
Christopher Swetman, his visitor, and his family kept indoors.&nbsp;
In the evening, however, Swetman came out from his gate, and, harkening
in silence to these tidings and more, wondered what might be in store
for him for his last night&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>He returned homeward by a path across the mead that skirted his own
orchard.&nbsp; Passing here, he heard the voice of his daughter Leonard
expostulating inside the hedge, her words being: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
ye, sir; don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I prithee let me go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sweetheart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;ve a-promised another!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peeping through, as he could not help doing, he saw the girl struggling
in the arms of the stranger, who was attempting to kiss her; but finding
her resistance to be genuine, and her distress unfeigned, he reluctantly
let her go.</p>
<p>Swetman&rsquo;s face grew dark, for his girls were more to him than
himself.&nbsp; He hastened on, meditating moodily all the way.&nbsp;
He entered the gate, and made straight for the orchard.&nbsp; When he
reached it his daughter had disappeared, but the stranger was still
standing there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said the yeoman, his anger having in no wise abated,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen what has happened!&nbsp; I have taken &rsquo;ee
into my house, at some jeopardy to myself; and, whoever you be, the
least I expected of &rsquo;ee was to treat the maidens with a seemly
respect.&nbsp; You have not done it, and I no longer trust you.&nbsp;
I am the more watchful over them in that they are motherless; and I
must ask &rsquo;ee to go after dark this night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stranger seemed dazed at discovering what his impulse had brought
down upon his head, and his pale face grew paler.&nbsp; He did not reply
for a time.&nbsp; When he did speak his soft voice was thick with feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I own that I am in the wrong,
if you take the matter gravely.&nbsp; We do not what we would but what
we must.&nbsp; Though I have not injured your daughter as a woman, I
have been treacherous to her as a hostess and friend in need.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go, as you say; I can do no less.&nbsp; I shall doubtless
find a refuge elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked towards the house in silence, where Swetman insisted
that his guest should have supper before departing.&nbsp; By the time
this was eaten it was dusk and the stranger announced that he was ready.</p>
<p>They went upstairs to where the garments and sword lay hidden, till
the departing one said that on further thought he would ask another
favour: that he should be allowed to retain the clothes he wore, and
that his host would keep the others and the sword till he, the speaker,
should come or send for them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; said Swetman.&nbsp; &lsquo;The gain is
on my side; for those clouts were but kept to dress a scarecrow next
fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They suit my case,&rsquo; said the stranger sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;However
much they may misfit me, they do not misfit my sorry fortune now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, then,&rsquo; said Christopher relenting, &lsquo;I was
too hasty.&nbsp; Sh&rsquo;lt bide!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the other would not, saying that it was better that things should
take their course.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that Swetman importuned him,
he only added, &lsquo;If I never come again, do with my belongings as
you list.&nbsp; In the pocket you will find a gold snuff-box, and in
the snuff-box fifty gold pieces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But keep &rsquo;em for thy use, man!&rsquo; said the yeoman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says the parting guest; &lsquo;they are foreign
pieces and would harm me if I were taken.&nbsp; Do as I bid thee.&nbsp;
Put away these things again and take especial charge of the sword.&nbsp;
It belonged to my father&rsquo;s father and I value it much.&nbsp; But
something more common becomes me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saying which, he took, as he went downstairs, one of the ash sticks
used by Swetman himself for walking with.&nbsp; The yeoman lighted him
out to the garden hatch, where he disappeared through Clammers Gate
by the road that crosses King&rsquo;s-Hintock Park to Evershead.</p>
<p>Christopher returned to the upstairs chamber, and sat down on his
bed reflecting.&nbsp; Then he examined the things left behind, and surely
enough in one of the pockets the gold snuff-box was revealed, containing
the fifty gold pieces as stated by the fugitive.&nbsp; The yeoman next
looked at the sword which its owner had stated to have belonged to his
grandfather.&nbsp; It was two-edged, so that he almost feared to handle
it.&nbsp; On the blade was inscribed the words &lsquo;ANDREA FERARA,&rsquo;
and among the many fine chasings were a rose and crown, the plume of
the Prince of Wales, and two portraits; portraits of a man and a woman,
the man&rsquo;s having the face of the first King Charles, and the woman&rsquo;s,
apparently, that of his Queen.</p>
<p>Swetman, much awed and surprised, returned the articles to the closet,
and went downstairs pondering.&nbsp; Of his surmise he said nothing
to his daughters, merely declaring to them that the gentleman was gone;
and never revealing that he had been an eye-witness of the unpleasant
scene in the orchard that was the immediate cause of the departure.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred in Hintock during the week that followed, beyond
the fitful arrival of more decided tidings concerning the utter defeat
of the Duke&rsquo;s army and his own disappearance at an early stage
of the battle.&nbsp; Then it was told that Monmouth was taken, not in
his own clothes but in the disguise of a countryman.&nbsp; He had been
sent to London, and was confined in the Tower.</p>
<p>The possibility that his guest had been no other than the Duke made
Swetman unspeakably sorry now; his heart smote him at the thought that,
acting so harshly for such a small breach of good faith, he might have
been the means of forwarding the unhappy fugitive&rsquo;s capture.&nbsp;
On the girls coming up to him he said, &lsquo;Get away with ye, wenches:
I fear you have been the ruin of an unfortunate man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the Tuesday night following, when the yeoman was sleeping as usual
in his chamber, he was, he said, conscious of the entry of some one.&nbsp;
Opening his eyes, he beheld by the light of the moon, which shone upon
the front of his house, the figure of a man who seemed to be the stranger
moving from the door towards the closet.&nbsp; He was dressed somewhat
differently now, but the face was quite that of his late guest in its
tragical pensiveness, as was also the tallness of his figure.&nbsp;
He neared the closet; and, feeling his visitor to be within his rights,
Christopher refrained from stirring.&nbsp; The personage turned his
large haggard eyes upon the bed where Swetman lay, and then withdrew
from their hiding the articles that belonged to him, again giving a
hard gaze at Christopher as he went noiselessly out of the chamber with
his properties on his arm.&nbsp; His retreat down the stairs was just
audible, and also his departure by the side door, through which entrance
or exit was easy to those who knew the place.</p>
<p>Nothing further happened, and towards morning Swetman slept.&nbsp;
To avoid all risk he said not a word to the girls of the visit of the
night, and certainly not to any one outside the house; for it was dangerous
at that time to avow anything.</p>
<p>Among the killed in opposing the recent rising had been a younger
brother of the lord of the manor, who lived at King&rsquo;s-Hintock
Court hard by.&nbsp; Seeing the latter ride past in mourning clothes
next day, Swetman ventured to condole with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d no business there!&rsquo; answered the other.&nbsp;
His words and manner showed the bitterness that was mingled with his
regret.&nbsp; &lsquo;But say no more of him.&nbsp; You know what has
happened since, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that they say Monmouth is taken, Sir Thomas, but I
can&rsquo;t think it true,&rsquo; answered Swetman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O zounds! &rsquo;tis true enough,&rsquo; cried the knight,
&lsquo;and that&rsquo;s not all.&nbsp; The Duke was executed on Tower
Hill two days ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;ye say it verily?&rsquo; says Swetman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very hard death he had, worse luck for &lsquo;n,&rsquo;
said Sir Thomas.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, &rsquo;tis over for him and over
for my brother.&nbsp; But not for the rest.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be
searchings and siftings down here anon; and happy is the man who has
had nothing to do with this matter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Swetman had hardly heard the latter words, so much was he confounded
by the strangeness of the tidings that the Duke had come to his death
on the previous Tuesday.&nbsp; For it had been only the night before
this present day of Friday that he had seen his former guest, whom he
had ceased to doubt could be other than the Duke, come into his chamber
and fetch away his accoutrements as he had promised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been a vision,&rsquo; said Christopher
to himself when the knight had ridden on.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll
go straight and see if the things be in the closet still; and thus I
shall surely learn if &rsquo;twere a vision or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the closet he went, which he had not looked into since the stranger&rsquo;s
departure.&nbsp; And searching behind the articles placed to conceal
the things hidden, he found that, as he had never doubted, they were
gone.</p>
<p>When the rumour spread abroad in the West that the man beheaded in
the Tower was not indeed the Duke, but one of his officers taken after
the battle, and that the Duke had been assisted to escape out of the
country, Swetman found in it an explanation of what so deeply mystified
him.&nbsp; That his visitor might have been a friend of the Duke&rsquo;s,
whom the Duke had asked to fetch the things in a last request, Swetman
would never admit.&nbsp; His belief in the rumour that Monmouth lived,
like that of thousands of others, continued to the end of his days.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Such, briefly, concluded my kinsman, is the tradition which has been
handed down in Christopher Swetman&rsquo;s family for the last two hundred
years.</p>
<h2>A MERE INTERLUDE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The traveller in school-books, who vouched in dryest tones for the
fidelity to fact of the following narrative, used to add a ring of truth
to it by opening with a nicety of criticism on the heroine&rsquo;s personality.&nbsp;
People were wrong, he declared, when they surmised that Baptista Trewthen
was a young woman with scarcely emotions or character.&nbsp; There was
nothing in her to love, and nothing to hate&mdash;so ran the general
opinion.&nbsp; That she showed few positive qualities was true.&nbsp;
The colours and tones which changing events paint on the faces of active
womankind were looked for in vain upon hers.&nbsp; But still waters
run deep; and no crisis had come in the years of her early maidenhood
to demonstrate what lay hidden within her, like metal in a mine.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of a small farmer in St. Maria&rsquo;s, one
of the Isles of Lyonesse beyond Off-Wessex, who had spent a large sum,
as there understood, on her education, by sending her to the mainland
for two years.&nbsp; At nineteen she was entered at the Training College
for Teachers, and at twenty-one nominated to a school in the country,
near Tor-upon-Sea, whither she proceeded after the Christmas examination
and holidays.</p>
<p>The months passed by from winter to spring and summer, and Baptista
applied herself to her new duties as best she could, till an uneventful
year had elapsed.&nbsp; Then an air of abstraction pervaded her bearing
as she walked to and fro, twice a day, and she showed the traits of
a person who had something on her mind.&nbsp; A widow, by name Mrs.
Wace, in whose house Baptista Trewthen had been provided with a sitting-room
and bedroom till the school-house should be built, noticed this change
in her youthful tenant&rsquo;s manner, and at last ventured to press
her with a few questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has nothing to do with the place, nor with you,&rsquo;
said Miss Trewthen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is the salary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nor the salary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is something you have heard from home, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baptista was silent for a few moments.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is Mr. Heddegan,&rsquo;
she murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Him they used to call David Heddegan before
he got his money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is the Mr. Heddegan they used to call David?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An old bachelor at Giant&rsquo;s Town, St. Maria&rsquo;s,
with no relations whatever, who lives about a stone&rsquo;s throw from
father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When I was a child he used to take me on his knee
and say he&rsquo;d marry me some day.&nbsp; Now I am a woman the jest
has turned earnest, and he is anxious to do it.&nbsp; And father and
mother says I can&rsquo;t do better than have him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s well off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s the richest man we know&mdash;as a friend
and neighbour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much older did you say he was than yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; Twenty years at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And an unpleasant man in the bargain perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;he&rsquo;s not unpleasant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, child, all I can say is that I&rsquo;d resist any such
engagement if it&rsquo;s not palatable to &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; You are comfortable
here, in my little house, I hope.&nbsp; All the parish like &rsquo;ee:
and I&rsquo;ve never been so cheerful, since my poor husband left me
to wear his wings, as I&rsquo;ve been with &rsquo;ee as my lodger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The schoolmistress assured her landlady that she could return the
sentiment.&nbsp; &lsquo;But here comes my perplexity,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like keeping school.&nbsp; Ah, you are surprised&mdash;you
didn&rsquo;t suspect it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve concealed
my feeling.&nbsp; Well, I simply hate school.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care
for children&mdash;they are unpleasant, troublesome little things, whom
nothing would delight so much as to hear that you had fallen down dead.&nbsp;
Yet I would even put up with them if it was not for the inspector.&nbsp;
For three months before his visit I didn&rsquo;t sleep soundly.&nbsp;
And the Committee of Council are always changing the Code, so that you
don&rsquo;t know what to teach, and what to leave untaught.&nbsp; I
think father and mother are right.&nbsp; They say I shall never excel
as a schoolmistress if I dislike the work so, and that therefore I ought
to get settled by marrying Mr. Heddegan.&nbsp; Between us two, I like
him better than school; but I don&rsquo;t like him quite so much as
to wish to marry him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These conversations, once begun, were continued from day to day;
till at length the young girl&rsquo;s elderly friend and landlady threw
in her opinion on the side of Miss Trewthen&rsquo;s parents.&nbsp; All
things considered, she declared, the uncertainty of the school, the
labour, Baptista&rsquo;s natural dislike for teaching, it would be as
well to take what fate offered, and make the best of matters by wedding
her father&rsquo;s old neighbour and prosperous friend.</p>
<p>The Easter holidays came round, and Baptista went to spend them as
usual in her native isle, going by train into Off-Wessex and crossing
by packet from Pen-zephyr.&nbsp; When she returned in the middle of
April her face wore a more settled aspect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said the expectant Mrs. Wace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have agreed to have him as my husband,&rsquo; said Baptista,
in an off-hand way.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven knows if it will be for the
best or not.&nbsp; But I have agreed to do it, and so the matter is
settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wace commended her; but Baptista did not care to dwell on the
subject; so that allusion to it was very infrequent between them.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, among other things, she repeated to the widow from time
to time in monosyllabic remarks that the wedding was really impending;
that it was arranged for the summer, and that she had given notice of
leaving the school at the August holidays.&nbsp; Later on she announced
more specifically that her marriage was to take place immediately after
her return home at the beginning of the month aforesaid.</p>
<p>She now corresponded regularly with Mr. Heddegan.&nbsp; Her letters
from him were seen, at least on the outside, and in part within, by
Mrs. Wace.&nbsp; Had she read more of their interiors than the occasional
sentences shown her by Baptista she would have perceived that the scratchy,
rusty handwriting of Miss Trewthen&rsquo;s betrothed conveyed little
more matter than details of their future housekeeping, and his preparations
for the same, with innumerable &lsquo;my dears&rsquo; sprinkled in disconnectedly,
to show the depth of his affection without the inconveniences of syntax.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>It was the end of July&mdash;dry, too dry, even for the season, the
delicate green herbs and vegetables that grew in this favoured end of
the kingdom tasting rather of the watering-pot than of the pure fresh
moisture from the skies.&nbsp; Baptista&rsquo;s boxes were packed, and
one Saturday morning she departed by a waggonette to the station, and
thence by train to Pen-zephyr, from which port she was, as usual, to
cross the water immediately to her home, and become Mr. Heddegan&rsquo;s
wife on the Wednesday of the week following.</p>
<p>She might have returned a week sooner.&nbsp; But though the wedding
day had loomed so near, and the banns were out, she delayed her departure
till this last moment, saying it was not necessary for her to be at
home long beforehand.&nbsp; As Mr. Heddegan was older than herself,
she said, she was to be married in her ordinary summer bonnet and grey
silk frock, and there were no preparations to make that had not been
amply made by her parents and intended husband.</p>
<p>In due time, after a hot and tedious journey, she reached Pen-zephyr.&nbsp;
She here obtained some refreshment, and then went towards the pier,
where she learnt to her surprise that the little steamboat plying between
the town and the islands had left at eleven o&rsquo;clock; the usual
hour of departure in the afternoon having been forestalled in consequence
of the fogs which had for a few days prevailed towards evening, making
twilight navigation dangerous.</p>
<p>This being Saturday, there was now no other boat till Tuesday, and
it became obvious that here she would have to remain for the three days,
unless her friends should think fit to rig out one of the island&rsquo;
sailing-boats and come to fetch her&mdash;a not very likely contingency,
the sea distance being nearly forty miles.</p>
<p>Baptista, however, had been detained in Pen-zephyr on more than one
occasion before, either on account of bad weather or some such reason
as the present, and she was therefore not in any personal alarm.&nbsp;
But, as she was to be married on the following Wednesday, the delay
was certainly inconvenient to a more than ordinary degree, since it
would leave less than a day&rsquo;s interval between her arrival and
the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Apart from this awkwardness she did not much mind the accident.&nbsp;
It was indeed curious to see how little she minded.&nbsp; Perhaps it
would not be too much to say that, although she was going to do the
critical deed of her life quite willingly, she experienced an indefinable
relief at the postponement of her meeting with Heddegan.&nbsp; But her
manner after making discovery of the hindrance was quiet and subdued,
even to passivity itself; as was instanced by her having, at the moment
of receiving information that the steamer had sailed, replied &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo;
so coolly to the porter with her luggage, that he was almost disappointed
at her lack of disappointment.</p>
<p>The question now was, should she return again to Mrs. Wace, in the
village of Lower Wessex, or wait in the town at which she had arrived.&nbsp;
She would have preferred to go back, but the distance was too great;
moreover, having left the place for good, and somewhat dramatically,
to become a bride, a return, even for so short a space, would have been
a trifle humiliating.</p>
<p>Leaving, then, her boxes at the station, her next anxiety was to
secure a respectable, or rather genteel, lodging in the popular seaside
resort confronting her.&nbsp; To this end she looked about the town,
in which, though she had passed through it half-a-dozen times, she was
practically a stranger.</p>
<p>Baptista found a room to suit her over a fruiterer&rsquo;s shop;
where she made herself at home, and set herself in order after her journey.&nbsp;
An early cup of tea having revived her spirits she walked out to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>Being a schoolmistress she avoided looking at the schools, and having
a sort of trade connection with books, she avoided looking at the booksellers;
but wearying of the other shops she inspected the churches; not that
for her own part she cared much about ecclesiastical edifices; but tourists
looked at them, and so would she&mdash;a proceeding for which no one
would have credited her with any great originality, such, for instance,
as that she subsequently showed herself to possess.&nbsp; The churches
soon oppressed her.&nbsp; She tried the Museum, but came out because
it seemed lonely and tedious.</p>
<p>Yet the town and the walks in this land of strawberries, these headquarters
of early English flowers and fruit, were then, as always, attractive.&nbsp;
From the more picturesque streets she went to the town gardens, and
the Pier, and the Harbour, and looked at the men at work there, loading
and unloading as in the time of the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Baptista?&nbsp; Yes, Baptista it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words were uttered behind her.&nbsp; Turning round she gave a
start, and became confused, even agitated, for a moment.&nbsp; Then
she said in her usual undemonstrative manner, &lsquo;O&mdash;is it really
you, Charles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without speaking again at once, and with a half-smile, the new-comer
glanced her over.&nbsp; There was much criticism, and some resentment&mdash;even
temper&mdash;in his eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going home,&rsquo; continued she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I
have missed the boat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He scarcely seemed to take in the meaning of this explanation, in
the intensity of his critical survey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Teaching still?&nbsp;
What a fine schoolmistress you make, Baptista, I warrant!&rsquo; he
said with a slight flavour of sarcasm, which was not lost upon her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I am nothing to brag of,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I have given up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;given up?&nbsp; You astonish me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate the profession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s because I am in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, it isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I am going to enter on another
life altogether.&nbsp; I am going to be married next week to Mr. David
Heddegan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man&mdash;fortified as he was by a natural cynical pride
and passionateness&mdash;winced at this unexpected reply, notwithstanding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is Mr. David Heddegan?&rsquo; he asked, as indifferently
as lay in his power.</p>
<p>She informed him the bearer of the name was a general merchant of
Giant&rsquo;s Town, St. Maria&rsquo;s island&mdash;her father&rsquo;s
nearest neighbour and oldest friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we shan&rsquo;t see anything more of you on the mainland?&rsquo;
inquired the schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; said Miss Trewthen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here endeth the career of the belle of the boarding-school
your father was foolish enough to send you to.&nbsp; A &ldquo;general
merchant&rsquo;s&rdquo; wife in the Lyonesse Isles.&nbsp; Will you sell
pounds of soap and pennyworths of tin tacks, or whole bars of saponaceous
matter, and great tenpenny nails?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not in such a small way as that!&rsquo; she almost
pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;He owns ships, though they are rather little ones!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, well, it is much the same.&nbsp; Come, let us walk on;
it is tedious to stand still.&nbsp; I thought you would be a failure
in education,&rsquo; he continued, when she obeyed him and strolled
ahead.&nbsp; &lsquo;You never showed power that way.&nbsp; You remind
me much of some of those women who think they are sure to be great actresses
if they go on the stage, because they have a pretty face, and forget
that what we require is acting.&nbsp; But you found your mistake, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t taunt me, Charles.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was noticeable
that the young schoolmaster&rsquo;s tone caused her no anger or retaliatory
passion; far otherwise: there was a tear in her eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
is it you are at Pen-zephyr?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t taunt you.&nbsp; I speak the truth, purely in
a friendly way, as I should to any one I wished well.&nbsp; Though for
that matter I might have some excuse even for taunting you.&nbsp; Such
a terrible hurry as you&rsquo;ve been in.&nbsp; I hate a woman who is
in such a hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;to be somebody&rsquo;s wife or other&mdash;anything&rsquo;s
wife rather than nobody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t wait for me,
O, no.&nbsp; Well, thank God, I&rsquo;m cured of all that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How merciless you are!&rsquo; she said bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait
for you?&nbsp; What does that mean, Charley?&nbsp; You never showed&mdash;anything
to wait for&mdash;anything special towards me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O come, Baptista dear; come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I mean is, nothing definite,&rsquo; she expostulated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose you liked me a little; but it seemed to me to be only
a pastime on your part, and that you never meant to make an honourable
engagement of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s just it!&nbsp; You girls expect a man
to mean business at the first look.&nbsp; No man when he first becomes
interested in a woman has any definite scheme of engagement to marry
her in his mind, unless he is meaning a vulgar mercenary marriage.&nbsp;
However, I <i>did</i> at last mean an honourable engagement, as you
call it, come to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you never said so, and an indefinite courtship soon injures
a woman&rsquo;s position and credit, sooner than you think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baptista, I solemnly declare that in six months I should have
asked you to marry me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She walked along in silence, looking on the ground, and appearing
very uncomfortable.&nbsp; Presently he said, &lsquo;Would you have waited
for me if you had known?&rsquo;&nbsp; To this she whispered in a sorrowful
whisper, &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went still farther in silence&mdash;passing along one of the
beautiful walks on the outskirts of the town, yet not observant of scene
or situation.&nbsp; Her shoulder and his were close together, and he
clasped his fingers round the small of her arm&mdash;quite lightly,
and without any attempt at impetus; yet the act seemed to say, &lsquo;Now
I hold you, and my will must be yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Recurring to a previous question of hers he said, &lsquo;I have merely
run down here for a day or two from school near Trufal, before going
off to the north for the rest of my holiday.&nbsp; I have seen my relations
at Redrutin quite lately, so I am not going there this time.&nbsp; How
little I thought of meeting you!&nbsp; How very different the circumstances
would have been if, instead of parting again as we must in half-an-hour
or so, possibly for ever, you had been now just going off with me, as
my wife, on our honeymoon trip.&nbsp; Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;well&mdash;so
humorous is life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must go back now&mdash;this
is altogether too painful, Charley!&nbsp; It is not at all a kind mood
you are in to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pain you&mdash;you know I do not,&rsquo;
he said more gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only it just exasperates me&mdash;this
you are going to do.&nbsp; I wish you would not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marry him.&nbsp; There, now I have showed you my true sentiments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must do it now,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; he asked, dropping the off-hand masterful tone
he had hitherto spoken in, and becoming earnest; still holding her arm,
however, as if she were his chattel to be taken up or put down at will.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is never too late to break off a marriage that&rsquo;s distasteful
to you.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll say one thing; and it is truth: I wish
you would marry me instead of him, even now, at the last moment, though
you have served me so badly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is not possible to think of that!&rsquo; she answered
hastily, shaking her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I get home all will be
prepared&mdash;it is ready even now&mdash;the things for the party,
the furniture, Mr. Heddegan&rsquo;s new suit, and everything.&nbsp;
I should require the courage of a tropical lion to go home there and
say I wouldn&rsquo;t carry out my promise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then go, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&nbsp; But there would be
no necessity for you to go home and face them in that way.&nbsp; If
we were to marry, it would have to be at once, instantly; or not at
all.&nbsp; I should think your affection not worth the having unless
you agreed to come back with me to Trufal this evening, where we could
be married by licence on Monday morning.&nbsp; And then no Mr. David
Heddegan or anybody else could get you away from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go home by the Tuesday boat,&rsquo; she faltered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What would they think if I did not come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could go home by that boat just the same.&nbsp; All the
difference would be that I should go with you.&nbsp; You could leave
me on the quay, where I&rsquo;d have a smoke, while you went and saw
your father and mother privately; you could then tell them what you
had done, and that I was waiting not far off; that I was a school-master
in a fairly good position, and a young man you had known when you were
at the Training College.&nbsp; Then I would come boldly forward; and
they would see that it could not be altered, and so you wouldn&rsquo;t
suffer a lifelong misery by being the wife of a wretched old gaffer
you don&rsquo;t like at all.&nbsp; Now, honestly; you do like me best,
don&rsquo;t you, Baptista?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we will do as I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not pronounce a clear affirmative.&nbsp; But that she consented
to the novel proposition at some moment or other of that walk was apparent
by what occurred a little later.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>An enterprise of such pith required, indeed, less talking than consideration.&nbsp;
The first thing they did in carrying it out was to return to the railway
station, where Baptista took from her luggage a small trunk of immediate
necessaries which she would in any case have required after missing
the boat.&nbsp; That same afternoon they travelled up the line to Trufal.</p>
<p>Charles Stow (as his name was), despite his disdainful indifference
to things, was very careful of appearances, and made the journey independently
of her though in the same train.&nbsp; He told her where she could get
board and lodgings in the city; and with merely a distant nod to her
of a provisional kind, went off to his own quarters, and to see about
the licence.</p>
<p>On Sunday she saw him in the morning across the nave of the pro-cathedral.&nbsp;
In the afternoon they walked together in the fields, where he told her
that the licence would be ready next day, and would be available the
day after, when the ceremony could be performed as early after eight
o&rsquo;clock as they should choose.</p>
<p>His courtship, thus renewed after an interval of two years, was as
impetuous, violent even, as it was short.&nbsp; The next day came and
passed, and the final arrangements were made.&nbsp; Their agreement
was to get the ceremony over as soon as they possibly could the next
morning, so as to go on to Pen-zephyr at once, and reach that place
in time for the boat&rsquo;s departure the same day.&nbsp; It was in
obedience to Baptista&rsquo;s earnest request that Stow consented thus
to make the whole journey to Lyonesse by land and water at one heat,
and not break it at Pen-zephyr; she seemed to be oppressed with a dread
of lingering anywhere, this great first act of disobedience to her parents
once accomplished, with the weight on her mind that her home had to
be convulsed by the disclosure of it.&nbsp; To face her difficulties
over the water immediately she had created them was, however, a course
more desired by Baptista than by her lover; though for once he gave
way.</p>
<p>The next morning was bright and warm as those which had preceded
it.&nbsp; By six o&rsquo;clock it seemed nearly noon, as is often the
case in that part of England in the summer season.&nbsp; By nine they
were husband and wife.&nbsp; They packed up and departed by the earliest
train after the service; and on the way discussed at length what she
should say on meeting her parents, Charley dictating the turn of each
phrase.&nbsp; In her anxiety they had travelled so early that when they
reached Pen-zephyr they found there were nearly two hours on their hands
before the steamer&rsquo;s time of sailing.</p>
<p>Baptista was extremely reluctant to be seen promenading the streets
of the watering-place with her husband till, as above stated, the household
at Giant&rsquo;s Town should know the unexpected course of events from
her own lips; and it was just possible, if not likely, that some Lyonessian
might be prowling about there, or even have come across the sea to look
for her.&nbsp; To meet any one to whom she was known, and to have to
reply to awkward questions about the strange young man at her side before
her well-framed announcement had been delivered at proper time and place,
was a thing she could not contemplate with equanimity.&nbsp; So, instead
of looking at the shops and harbour, they went along the coast a little
way.</p>
<p>The heat of the morning was by this time intense.&nbsp; They clambered
up on some cliffs, and while sitting there, looking around at St. Michael&rsquo;s
Mount and other objects, Charles said to her that he thought he would
run down to the beach at their feet, and take just one plunge into the
sea.</p>
<p>Baptista did not much like the idea of being left alone; it was gloomy,
she said.&nbsp; But he assured her he would not be gone more than a
quarter of an hour at the outside, and she passively assented.</p>
<p>Down he went, disappeared, appeared again, and looked back.&nbsp;
Then he again proceeded, and vanished, till, as a small waxen object,
she saw him emerge from the nook that had screened him, cross the white
fringe of foam, and walk into the undulating mass of blue.&nbsp; Once
in the water he seemed less inclined to hurry than before; he remained
a long time; and, unable either to appreciate his skill or criticize
his want of it at that distance, she withdrew her eyes from the spot,
and gazed at the still outline of St. Michael&rsquo;s&mdash;now beautifully
toned in grey.</p>
<p>Her anxiety for the hour of departure, and to cope at once with the
approaching incidents that she would have to manipulate as best she
could, sent her into a reverie.&nbsp; It was now Tuesday; she would
reach home in the evening&mdash;a very late time they would say; but,
as the delay was a pure accident, they would deem her marriage to Mr.
Heddegan to-morrow still practicable.&nbsp; Then Charles would have
to be produced from the background.&nbsp; It was a terrible undertaking
to think of, and she almost regretted her temerity in wedding so hastily
that morning.&nbsp; The rage of her father would be so crushing; the
reproaches of her mother so bitter; and perhaps Charles would answer
hotly, and perhaps cause estrangement till death.&nbsp; There had obviously
been no alarm about her at St. Maria&rsquo;s, or somebody would have
sailed across to inquire for her.&nbsp; She had, in a letter written
at the beginning of the week, spoken of the hour at which she intended
to leave her country schoolhouse; and from this her friends had probably
perceived that by such timing she would run a risk of losing the Saturday
boat.&nbsp; She had missed it, and as a consequence sat here on the
shore as Mrs. Charles Stow.</p>
<p>This brought her to the present, and she turned from the outline
of St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount to look about for her husband&rsquo;s form.&nbsp;
He was, as far as she could discover, no longer in the sea.&nbsp; Then
he was dressing.&nbsp; By moving a few steps she could see where his
clothes lay.&nbsp; But Charles was not beside them.</p>
<p>Baptista looked back again at the water in bewilderment, as if her
senses were the victim of some sleight of hand.&nbsp; Not a speck or
spot resembling a man&rsquo;s head or face showed anywhere.&nbsp; By
this time she was alarmed, and her alarm intensified when she perceived
a little beyond the scene of her husband&rsquo;s bathing a small area
of water, the quality of whose surface differed from that of the surrounding
expanse as the coarse vegetation of some foul patch in a mead differs
from the fine green of the remainder.&nbsp; Elsewhere it looked flexuous,
here it looked vermiculated and lumpy, and her marine experiences suggested
to her in a moment that two currents met and caused a turmoil at this
place.</p>
<p>She descended as hastily as her trembling limbs would allow.&nbsp;
The way down was terribly long, and before reaching the heap of clothes
it occurred to her that, after all, it would be best to run first for
help.&nbsp; Hastening along in a lateral direction she proceeded inland
till she met a man, and soon afterwards two others.&nbsp; To them she
exclaimed, &lsquo;I think a gentleman who was bathing is in some danger.&nbsp;
I cannot see him as I could.&nbsp; Will you please run and help him,
at once, if you will be so kind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not think of turning to show them the exact spot, indicating
it vaguely by the direction of her hand, and still going on her way
with the idea of gaining more assistance.&nbsp; When she deemed, in
her faintness, that she had carried the alarm far enough, she faced
about and dragged herself back again.&nbsp; Before reaching the now
dreaded spot she met one of the men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can see nothing at all, Miss,&rsquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Having gained the beach, she found the tide in, and no sign of Charley&rsquo;s
clothes.&nbsp; The other men whom she had besought to come had disappeared,
it must have been in some other direction, for she had not met them
going away.&nbsp; They, finding nothing, had probably thought her alarm
a mere conjecture, and given up the quest.</p>
<p>Baptista sank down upon the stones near at hand.&nbsp; Where Charley
had undressed was now sea.&nbsp; There could not be the least doubt
that he was drowned, and his body sucked under by the current; while
his clothes, lying within high-water mark, had probably been carried
away by the rising tide.</p>
<p>She remained in a stupor for some minutes, till a strange sensation
succeeded the aforesaid perceptions, mystifying her intelligence, and
leaving her physically almost inert.&nbsp; With his personal disappearance,
the last three days of her life with him seemed to be swallowed up,
also his image, in her mind&rsquo;s eye, waned curiously, receded far
away, grew stranger and stranger, less and less real.&nbsp; Their meeting
and marriage had been so sudden, unpremeditated, adventurous, that she
could hardly believe that she had played her part in such a reckless
drama.&nbsp; Of all the few hours of her life with Charles, the portion
that most insisted in coming back to memory was their fortuitous encounter
on the previous Saturday, and those bitter reprimands with which he
had begun the attack, as it might be called, which had piqued her to
an unexpected consummation.</p>
<p>A sort of cruelty, an imperiousness, even in his warmth, had characterized
Charles Stow.&nbsp; As a lover he had ever been a bit of a tyrant; and
it might pretty truly have been said that he had stung her into marriage
with him at last.&nbsp; Still more alien from her life did these reflections
operate to make him; and then they would be chased away by an interval
of passionate weeping and mad regret.&nbsp; Finally, there returned
upon the confused mind of the young wife the recollection that she was
on her way homeward, and that the packet would sail in three-quarters
of an hour.</p>
<p>Except the parasol in her hand, all she possessed was at the station
awaiting her onward journey.</p>
<p>She looked in that direction; and, entering one of those undemonstrative
phases so common with her, walked quietly on.</p>
<p>At first she made straight for the railway; but suddenly turning
she went to a shop and wrote an anonymous line announcing his death
by drowning to the only person she had ever heard Charles mention as
a relative.&nbsp; Posting this stealthily, and with a fearful look around
her, she seemed to acquire a terror of the late events, pursuing her
way to the station as if followed by a spectre.</p>
<p>When she got to the office she asked for the luggage that she had
left there on the Saturday as well as the trunk left on the morning
just lapsed.&nbsp; All were put in the boat, and she herself followed.&nbsp;
Quickly as these things had been done, the whole proceeding, nevertheless,
had been almost automatic on Baptista&rsquo;s part, ere she had come
to any definite conclusion on her course.</p>
<p>Just before the bell rang she heard a conversation on the pier, which
removed the last shade of doubt from her mind, if any had existed, that
she was Charles Stow&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; The sentences were but fragmentary,
but she could easily piece them out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man drowned&mdash;swam out too far&mdash;was a stranger
to the place&mdash;people in boat&mdash;saw him go down&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
get there in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The news was little more definite than this as yet; though it may
as well be stated once for all that the statement was true.&nbsp; Charley,
with the over-confidence of his nature, had ventured out too far for
his strength, and succumbed in the absence of assistance, his lifeless
body being at that moment suspended in the transparent mid-depths of
the bay.&nbsp; His clothes, however, had merely been gently lifted by
the rising tide, and floated into a nook hard by, where they lay out
of sight of the passers-by till a day or two after.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>In ten minutes they were steaming out of the harbour for their voyage
of four or five hours, at whose ending she would have to tell her strange
story.</p>
<p>As Pen-zephyr and all its environing scenes disappeared behind Mousehole
and St. Clement&rsquo;s Isle, Baptista&rsquo;s ephemeral, meteor-like
husband impressed her yet more as a fantasy.&nbsp; She was still in
such a trance-like state that she had been an hour on the little packet-boat
before she became aware of the agitating fact that Mr. Heddegan was
on board with her.&nbsp; Involuntarily she slipped from her left hand
the symbol of her wifehood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hee-hee!&nbsp; Well, the truth is, I wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon she don&rsquo;t see me, or won&rsquo;t
see me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s the hurry?&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
see enough o&rsquo; me soon!&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope ye be well, mee deer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a hale, well-conditioned man of about five and fifty, of the
complexion common to those whose lives are passed on the bluffs and
beaches of an ocean isle.&nbsp; He extended the four quarters of his
face in a genial smile, and his hand for a grasp of the same magnitude.&nbsp;
She gave her own in surprised docility, and he continued: &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
help coming across to meet &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; What an unfortunate thing
you missing the boat and not coming Saturday!&nbsp; They meant to have
warned &rsquo;ee that the time was changed, but forgot it at the last
moment.&nbsp; The truth is that I should have informed &rsquo;ee myself;
but I was that busy finishing up a job last week, so as to have this
week free, that I trusted to your father for attending to these little
things.&nbsp; However, so plain and quiet as it is all to be, it really
do not matter so much as it might otherwise have done, and I hope ye
haven&rsquo;t been greatly put out.&nbsp; Now, if you&rsquo;d sooner
that I should not be seen talking to &rsquo;ee&mdash;if &rsquo;ee feel
shy at all before strangers&mdash;just say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;ee
to yourself till we get home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you much.&nbsp; I am indeed a little tired, Mr. Heddegan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded urbane acquiescence, strolled away immediately, and minutely
inspected the surface of the funnel, till some female passengers of
Giant&rsquo;s Town tittered at what they must have thought a rebuff&mdash;for
the approaching wedding was known to many on St. Maria&rsquo;s Island,
though to nobody elsewhere.&nbsp; Baptista coloured at their satire,
and called him back, and forced herself to commune with him in at least
a mechanically friendly manner.</p>
<p>The opening event had been thus different from her expectation, and
she had adumbrated no act to meet it.&nbsp; Taken aback she passively
allowed circumstances to pilot her along; and so the voyage was made.</p>
<p>It was near dusk when they touched the pier of Giant&rsquo;s Town,
where several friends and neighbours stood awaiting them.&nbsp; Her
father had a lantern in his hand.&nbsp; Her mother, too, was there,
reproachfully glad that the delay had at last ended so simply.&nbsp;
Mrs. Trewthen and her daughter went together along the Giant&rsquo;s
Walk, or promenade, to the house, rather in advance of her husband and
Mr. Heddegan, who talked in loud tones which reached the women over
their shoulders.</p>
<p>Some would have called Mrs. Trewthen a good mother; but though well
meaning she was maladroit, and her intentions missed their mark.&nbsp;
This might have been partly attributable to the slight deafness from
which she suffered.&nbsp; Now, as usual, the chief utterances came from
her lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes, I&rsquo;m so glad, my child, that you&rsquo;ve got
over safe.&nbsp; It is all ready, and everything so well arranged, that
nothing but misfortune could hinder you settling as, with God&rsquo;s
grace, becomes &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Close to your mother&rsquo;s door a&rsquo;most,
&rsquo;twill be a great blessing, I&rsquo;m sure; and I was very glad
to find from your letters that you&rsquo;d held your word sacred.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right&mdash;make your word your bond always.&nbsp; Mrs.
Wace seems to be a sensible woman.&nbsp; I hope the Lord will do for
her as he&rsquo;s doing for you no long time hence.&nbsp; And how did
&rsquo;ee get over the terrible journey from Tor-upon-Sea to Pen-zephyr?&nbsp;
Once you&rsquo;d done with the railway, of course, you seemed quite
at home.&nbsp; Well, Baptista, conduct yourself seemly, and all will
be well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, Baptista entered the house, her father and Mr. Heddegan
immediately at her back.&nbsp; Her mother had been so didactic that
she had felt herself absolutely unable to broach the subjects in the
centre of her mind.</p>
<p>The familiar room, with the dark ceiling, the well-spread table,
the old chairs, had never before spoken so eloquently of the times ere
she knew or had heard of Charley Stow.&nbsp; She went upstairs to take
off her things, her mother remaining below to complete the disposition
of the supper, and attend to the preparation of to-morrow&rsquo;s meal,
altogether composing such an array of pies, from pies of fish to pies
of turnips, as was never heard of outside the Western Duchy.&nbsp; Baptista,
once alone, sat down and did nothing; and was called before she had
taken off her bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rsquo; she cried, jumping up, and speedily
disapparelling herself, brushed her hair with a few touches and went
down.</p>
<p>Two or three of Mr. Heddegan&rsquo;s and her father&rsquo;s friends
had dropped in, and expressed their sympathy for the delay she had been
subjected to.&nbsp; The meal was a most merry one except to Baptista.&nbsp;
She had desired privacy, and there was none; and to break the news was
already a greater difficulty than it had been at first.&nbsp; Everything
around her, animate and inanimate, great and small, insisted that she
had come home to be married; and she could not get a chance to say nay.</p>
<p>One or two people sang songs, as overtures to the melody of the morrow,
till at length bedtime came, and they all withdrew, her mother having
retired a little earlier.&nbsp; When Baptista found herself again alone
in her bedroom the case stood as before: she had come home with much
to say, and she had said nothing.</p>
<p>It was now growing clear even to herself that Charles being dead,
she had not determination sufficient within her to break tidings which,
had he been alive, would have imperatively announced themselves.&nbsp;
And thus with the stroke of midnight came the turning of the scale;
her story should remain untold.&nbsp; It was not that upon the whole
she thought it best not to attempt to tell it; but that she could not
undertake so explosive a matter.&nbsp; To stop the wedding now would
cause a convulsion in Giant&rsquo;s Town little short of volcanic.&nbsp;
Weakened, tired, and terrified as she had been by the day&rsquo;s adventures,
she could not make herself the author of such a catastrophe.&nbsp; But
how refuse Heddegan without telling?&nbsp; It really seemed to her as
if her marriage with Mr. Heddegan were about to take place as if nothing
had intervened.</p>
<p>Morning came.&nbsp; The events of the previous days were cut off
from her present existence by scene and sentiment more completely than
ever.&nbsp; Charles Stow had grown to be a special being of whom, owing
to his character, she entertained rather fearful than loving memory.&nbsp;
Baptista could hear when she awoke that her parents were already moving
about downstairs.&nbsp; But she did not rise till her mother&rsquo;s
rather rough voice resounded up the staircase as it had done on the
preceding evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baptista!&nbsp; Come, time to be stirring!&nbsp; The man will
be here, by heaven&rsquo;s blessing, in three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp;
He has looked in already for a minute or two&mdash;and says he&rsquo;s
going to the church to see if things be well forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baptista arose, looked out of the window, and took the easy course.&nbsp;
When she emerged from the regions above she was arrayed in her new silk
frock and best stockings, wearing a linen jacket over the former for
breakfasting, and her common slippers over the latter, not to spoil
the new ones on the rough precincts of the dwelling.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on this part of the
morning&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp; She revealed nothing; and married
Heddegan, as she had given her word to do, on that appointed August
day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Mr. Heddegan forgave the coldness of his bride&rsquo;s manner during
and after the wedding ceremony, full well aware that there had been
considerable reluctance on her part to acquiesce in this neighbourly
arrangement, and, as a philosopher of long standing, holding that whatever
Baptista&rsquo;s attitude now, the conditions would probably be much
the same six months hence as those which ruled among other married couples.</p>
<p>An absolutely unexpected shock was given to Baptista&rsquo;s listless
mind about an hour after the wedding service.&nbsp; They had nearly
finished the mid-day dinner when the now husband said to her father,
&lsquo;We think of starting about two.&nbsp; And the breeze being so
fair we shall bring up inside Pen-zephyr new pier about six at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;are we going to Pen-zephyr?&rsquo; said Baptista.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell her?&rsquo; asked her father of Heddegan.</p>
<p>It transpired that, owing to the delay in her arrival, this proposal
too, among other things, had in the hurry not been mentioned to her,
except some time ago as a general suggestion that they would go somewhere.&nbsp;
Heddegan had imagined that any trip would be pleasant, and one to the
mainland the pleasantest of all.</p>
<p>She looked so distressed at the announcement that her husband willingly
offered to give it up, though he had not had a holiday off the island
for a whole year.&nbsp; Then she pondered on the inconvenience of staying
at Giant&rsquo;s Town, where all the inhabitants were bonded, by the
circumstances of their situation, into a sort of family party, which
permitted and encouraged on such occasions as these oral criticism that
was apt to disturb the equanimity of newly married girls, and would
especially worry Baptista in her strange situation.&nbsp; Hence, unexpectedly,
she agreed not to disorganize her husband&rsquo;s plans for the wedding
jaunt, and it was settled that, as originally intended, they should
proceed in a neighbour&rsquo;s sailing boat to the metropolis of the
district.</p>
<p>In this way they arrived at Pen-zephyr without difficulty or mishap.&nbsp;
Bidding adieu to Jenkin and his man, who had sailed them over, they
strolled arm in arm off the pier, Baptista silent, cold, and obedient.&nbsp;
Heddegan had arranged to take her as far as Plymouth before their return,
but to go no further than where they had landed that day.&nbsp; Their
first business was to find an inn; and in this they had unexpected difficulty,
since for some reason or other&mdash;possibly the fine weather&mdash;many
of the nearest at hand were full of tourists and commercial travellers.&nbsp;
He led her on till he reached a tavern which, though comparatively unpretending,
stood in as attractive a spot as any in the town; and this, somewhat
to their surprise after their previous experience, they found apparently
empty.&nbsp; The considerate old man, thinking that Baptista was educated
to artistic notions, though he himself was deficient in them, had decided
that it was most desirable to have, on such an occasion as the present,
an apartment with &lsquo;a good view&rsquo; (the expression being one
he had often heard in use among tourists); and he therefore asked for
a favourite room on the first floor, from which a bow-window protruded,
for the express purpose of affording such an outlook.</p>
<p>The landlady, after some hesitation, said she was sorry that particular
apartment was engaged; the next one, however, or any other in the house,
was unoccupied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The gentleman who has the best one will give it up to-morrow,
and then you can change into it,&rsquo; she added, as Mr. Heddegan hesitated
about taking the adjoining and less commanding one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall be gone to-morrow, and shan&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Wishing not to lose customers, the landlady earnestly continued that
since he was bent on having the best room, perhaps the other gentleman
would not object to move at once into the one they despised, since,
though nothing could be seen from the window, the room was equally large.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if he doesn&rsquo;t care for a view,&rsquo; said Mr.
Heddegan, with the air of a highly artistic man who did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;I am sure he doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can promise that you shall have the room you want.&nbsp; If
you would not object to go for a walk for half an hour, I could have
it ready, and your things in it, and a nice tea laid in the bow-window
by the time you come back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This proposal was deemed satisfactory by the fussy old tradesman,
and they went out.&nbsp; Baptista nervously conducted him in an opposite
direction to her walk of the former day in other company, showing on
her wan face, had he observed it, how much she was beginning to regret
her sacrificial step for mending matters that morning.</p>
<p>She took advantage of a moment when her husband&rsquo;s back was
turned to inquire casually in a shop if anything had been heard of the
gentleman who was sucked down in the eddy while bathing.</p>
<p>The shopman said, &lsquo;Yes, his body has been washed ashore,&rsquo;
and had just handed Baptista a newspaper on which she discerned the
heading, &lsquo;A Schoolmaster drowned while bathing,&rsquo; when her
husband turned to join her.&nbsp; She might have pursued the subject
without raising suspicion; but it was more than flesh and blood could
do, and completing a small purchase almost ran out of the shop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your terrible hurry, mee deer?&rsquo; said Heddegan,
hastening after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to stay in shops,&rsquo;
she gasped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are
suffocating this weather.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go back and have some tay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They found the much desired apartment awaiting their entry.&nbsp;
It was a sort of combination bed and sitting-room, and the table was
prettily spread with high tea in the bow-window, a bunch of flowers
in the midst, and a best-parlour chair on each side.&nbsp; Here they
shared the meal by the ruddy light of the vanishing sun.&nbsp; But though
the view had been engaged, regardless of expense, exclusively for Baptista&rsquo;s
pleasure, she did not direct any keen attention out of the window.&nbsp;
Her gaze as often fell on the floor and walls of the room as elsewhere,
and on the table as much as on either, beholding nothing at all.</p>
<p>But there was a change.&nbsp; Opposite her seat was the door, upon
which her eyes presently became riveted like those of a little bird
upon a snake.&nbsp; For, on a peg at the back of the door, there hung
a hat; such a hat&mdash;surely, from its peculiar make, the actual hat&mdash;that
had been worn by Charles.&nbsp; Conviction grew to certainty when she
saw a railway ticket sticking up from the band.&nbsp; Charles had put
the ticket there&mdash;she had noticed the act.</p>
<p>Her teeth almost chattered; she murmured something incoherent.&nbsp;
Her husband jumped up and said, &lsquo;You are not well!&nbsp; What
is it?&nbsp; What shall I get &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smelling salts!&rsquo; she said, quickly and desperately;
&lsquo;at that chemist&rsquo;s shop you were in just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He jumped up like the anxious old man that he was, caught up his
own hat from a back table, and without observing the other hastened
out and downstairs.</p>
<p>Left alone she gazed and gazed at the back of the door, then spasmodically
rang the bell.&nbsp; An honest-looking country maid-servant appeared
in response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hat!&rsquo; murmured Baptista, pointing with her finger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It does not belong to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, I&rsquo;ll take it away,&rsquo; said the young woman
with some hurry.&nbsp; &lsquo;It belongs to the other gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with a certain awkwardness, and took the hat out of the
room.&nbsp; Baptista had recovered her outward composure.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
other gentleman?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the other gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the next room, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; He removed
out of this to oblige &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you say so?&nbsp; I should hear him if he were there,&rsquo;
said Baptista, sufficiently recovered to argue down an apparent untruth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s there,&rsquo; said the girl, hardily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is strange that he makes no noise,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Heddegan, convicting the girl of falsity by a look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He makes no noise; but it is not strange,&rsquo; said the
servant.</p>
<p>All at once a dread took possession of the bride&rsquo;s heart, like
a cold hand laid thereon; for it flashed upon her that there was a possibility
of reconciling the girl&rsquo;s statement with her own knowledge of
facts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why does he make no noise?&rsquo; she weakly said.</p>
<p>The waiting-maid was silent, and looked at her questioner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I tell you, ma&rsquo;am, you won&rsquo;t tell missis?&rsquo;
she whispered.</p>
<p>Baptista promised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s a-lying dead!&rsquo; said the girl.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the schoolmaster that was drownded yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&rsquo; said the bride, covering her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
he was in this room till just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the maid, thinking the young lady&rsquo;s
agitation natural enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I told missis that I thought
she oughtn&rsquo;t to have done it, because I don&rsquo;t hold it right
to keep visitors so much in the dark where death&rsquo;s concerned;
but she said the gentleman didn&rsquo;t die of anything infectious;
she was a poor, honest, innkeeper&rsquo;s wife, she says, who had to
get her living by making hay while the sun sheened.&nbsp; And owing
to the drownded gentleman being brought here, she said, it kept so many
people away that we were empty, though all the other houses were full.&nbsp;
So when your good man set his mind upon the room, and she would have
lost good paying folk if he&rsquo;d not had it, it wasn&rsquo;t to be
supposed, she said, that she&rsquo;d let anything stand in the way.&nbsp;
Ye won&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve told ye, please, m&rsquo;m?&nbsp;
All the linen has been changed, and as the inquest won&rsquo;t be till
to-morrow, after you are gone, she thought you wouldn&rsquo;t know a
word of it, being strangers here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The returning footsteps of her husband broke off further narration.&nbsp;
Baptista waved her hand, for she could not speak.&nbsp; The waiting-maid
quickly withdrew, and Mr. Heddegan entered with the smelling salts and
other nostrums.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any better?&rsquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the hotel,&rsquo; she exclaimed, almost
simultaneously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t
suit me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all that&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he returned pettishly
(this being the first time of his showing such a mood).&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon
my heart and life such trifling is trying to any man&rsquo;s temper,
Baptista!&nbsp; Sending me about from here to yond, and then when I
come back saying &rsquo;ee don&rsquo;t like the place that I have sunk
so much money and words to get for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Od dang it
all, &rsquo;tis enough to&mdash;But I won&rsquo;t say any more at present,
mee deer, though it is just too much to expect to turn out of the house
now.&nbsp; We shan&rsquo;t get another quiet place at this time of the
evening&mdash;every other inn in the town is bustling with rackety folk
of one sort and t&rsquo;other, while here &rsquo;tis as quiet as the
grave&mdash;the country, I would say.&nbsp; So bide still, d&rsquo;ye
hear, and to-morrow we shall be out of the town altogether&mdash;as
early as you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The obstinacy of age had, in short, overmastered its complaisance,
and the young woman said no more.&nbsp; The simple course of telling
him that in the adjoining room lay a corpse which had lately occupied
their own might, it would have seemed, have been an effectual one without
further disclosure, but to allude to that subject, however it was disguised,
was more than Heddegan&rsquo;s young wife had strength for.&nbsp; Horror
broke her down.&nbsp; In the contingency one thing only presented itself
to her paralyzed regard&mdash;that here she was doomed to abide, in
a hideous contiguity to the dead husband and the living, and her conjecture
did, in fact, bear itself out.&nbsp; That night she lay between the
two men she had married&mdash;Heddegan on the one hand, and on the other
through the partition against which the bed stood, Charles Stow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>Kindly time had withdrawn the foregoing event three days from the
present of Baptista Heddegan.&nbsp; It was ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning; she had been ill, not in an ordinary or definite sense, but
in a state of cold stupefaction, from which it was difficult to arouse
her so much as to say a few sentences.&nbsp; When questioned she had
replied that she was pretty well.</p>
<p>Their trip, as such, had been something of a failure.&nbsp; They
had gone on as far as Falmouth, but here he had given way to her entreaties
to return home.&nbsp; This they could not very well do without repassing
through Pen-zephyr, at which place they had now again arrived.</p>
<p>In the train she had seen a weekly local paper, and read there a
paragraph detailing the inquest on Charles.&nbsp; It was added that
the funeral was to take place at his native town of Redrutin on Friday.</p>
<p>After reading this she had shown no reluctance to enter the fatal
neighbourhood of the tragedy, only stipulating that they should take
their rest at a different lodging from the first; and now comparatively
braced up and calm&mdash;indeed a cooler creature altogether than when
last in the town, she said to David that she wanted to walk out for
a while, as they had plenty of time on their hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To a shop as usual, I suppose, mee deer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly for shopping,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And it
will be best for you, dear, to stay in after trotting about so much,
and have a good rest while I am gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He assented; and Baptista sallied forth.&nbsp; As she had stated,
her first visit was made to a shop, a draper&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Without
the exercise of much choice she purchased a black bonnet and veil, also
a black stuff gown; a black mantle she already wore.&nbsp; These articles
were made up into a parcel which, in spite of the saleswoman&rsquo;s
offers, her customer said she would take with her.&nbsp; Bearing it
on her arm she turned to the railway, and at the station got a ticket
for Redrutin.</p>
<p>Thus it appeared that, on her recovery from the paralyzed mood of
the former day, while she had resolved not to blast utterly the happiness
of her present husband by revealing the history of the departed one,
she had also determined to indulge a certain odd, inconsequent, feminine
sentiment of decency, to the small extent to which it could do no harm
to any person.&nbsp; At Redrutin she emerged from the railway carriage
in the black attire purchased at the shop, having during the transit
made the change in the empty compartment she had chosen.&nbsp; The other
clothes were now in the bandbox and parcel.&nbsp; Leaving these at the
cloak-room she proceeded onward, and after a wary survey reached the
side of a hill whence a view of the burial ground could be obtained.</p>
<p>It was now a little before two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; While Baptista
waited a funeral procession ascended the road.&nbsp; Baptista hastened
across, and by the time the procession entered the cemetery gates she
had unobtrusively joined it.</p>
<p>In addition to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s own relatives (not a few),
the paragraph in the newspapers of his death by drowning had drawn together
many neighbours, acquaintances, and onlookers.&nbsp; Among them she
passed unnoticed, and with a quiet step pursued the winding path to
the chapel, and afterwards thence to the grave.&nbsp; When all was over,
and the relatives and idlers had withdrawn, she stepped to the edge
of the chasm.&nbsp; From beneath her mantle she drew a little bunch
of forget-me-nots, and dropped them in upon the coffin.&nbsp; In a few
minutes she also turned and went away from the cemetery.&nbsp; By five
o&rsquo;clock she was again in Pen-zephyr.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been a mortal long time!&rsquo; said her husband,
crossly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I allowed you an hour at most, mee deer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It occupied me longer,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I reckon it is wasting words to complain.&nbsp;
Hang it, ye look so tired and wisht that I can&rsquo;t find heart to
say what I would!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am&mdash;weary and wisht, David; I am.&nbsp; We can get
home to-morrow for certain, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can.&nbsp; And please God we will!&rsquo; said Mr. Heddegan
heartily, as if he too were weary of his brief honeymoon.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
must be into business again on Monday morning at latest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They left by the next morning steamer, and in the afternoon took
up their residence in their own house at Giant&rsquo;s Town.</p>
<p>The hour that she reached the island it was as if a material weight
had been removed from Baptista&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp; Her husband
attributed the change to the influence of the local breezes after the
hot-house atmosphere of the mainland.&nbsp; However that might be, settled
here, a few doors from her mother&rsquo;s dwelling, she recovered in
no very long time much of her customary bearing, which was never very
demonstrative.&nbsp; She accepted her position calmly, and faintly smiled
when her neighbours learned to call her Mrs. Heddegan, and said she
seemed likely to become the leader of fashion in Giant&rsquo;s Town.</p>
<p>Her husband was a man who had made considerably more money by trade
than her father had done: and perhaps the greater profusion of surroundings
at her command than she had heretofore been mistress of, was not without
an effect upon her.&nbsp; One week, two weeks, three weeks passed; and,
being pre-eminently a young woman who allowed things to drift, she did
nothing whatever either to disclose or conceal traces of her first marriage;
or to learn if there existed possibilities&mdash;which there undoubtedly
did&mdash;by which that hasty contract might become revealed to those
about her at any unexpected moment.</p>
<p>While yet within the first month of her marriage, and on an evening
just before sunset, Baptista was standing within her garden adjoining
the house, when she saw passing along the road a personage clad in a
greasy black coat and battered tall hat, which, common enough in the
slums of a city, had an odd appearance in St. Maria&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
tramp, as he seemed to be, marked her at once&mdash;bonnetless and unwrapped
as she was her features were plainly recognizable&mdash;and with an
air of friendly surprise came and leant over the wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>She had some dim recollection of his face, but said that she was
not acquainted with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, your witness to be sure, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you mind the man that was mending the church-window when you and your
intended husband walked up to be made one; and the clerk called me down
from the ladder, and I came and did my part by writing my name and occupation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baptista glanced quickly around; her husband was out of earshot.&nbsp;
That would have been of less importance but for the fact that the wedding
witnessed by this personage had not been the wedding with Mr. Heddegan,
but the one on the day previous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a misfortune since then, that&rsquo;s pulled
me under,&rsquo; continued her friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t
let me damp yer wedded joy by naming the particulars.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ve
seen changes since; though &rsquo;tis but a short time ago&mdash;let
me see, only a month next week, I think; for &rsquo;twere the first
or second day in August.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s when it was,&rsquo; said another man,
a sailor, who had come up with a pipe in his mouth, and felt it necessary
to join in (Baptista having receded to escape further speech).&nbsp;
&lsquo;For that was the first time I set foot in Giant&rsquo;s Town;
and her husband took her to him the same day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A dialogue then proceeded between the two men outside the wall, which
Baptista could not help hearing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, I signed the book that made her one flesh,&rsquo; repeated
the decayed glazier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s her goodman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the premises somewhere; but you don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em
together much,&rsquo; replied the sailor in an undertone.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
see, he&rsquo;s older than she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Older?&nbsp; I should never have thought it from my own observation,&rsquo;
said the glazier.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a remarkably handsome man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Handsome?&nbsp; Well, there he is&mdash;we can see for ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>David Heddegan had, indeed, just shown himself at the upper end of
the garden; and the glazier, looking in bewilderment from the husband
to the wife, saw the latter turn pale.</p>
<p>Now that decayed glazier was a far-seeing and cunning man&mdash;too
far-seeing and cunning to allow himself to thrive by simple and straightforward
means&mdash;and he held his peace, till he could read more plainly the
meaning of this riddle, merely adding carelessly, &lsquo;Well&mdash;marriage
do alter a man, &rsquo;tis true.&nbsp; I should never ha&rsquo; knowed
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then stared oddly at the disconcerted Baptista, and moving on
to where he could again address her, asked her to do him a good turn,
since he once had done the same for her.&nbsp; Understanding that he
meant money, she handed him some, at which he thanked her, and instantly
went away.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>She had escaped exposure on this occasion; but the incident had been
an awkward one, and should have suggested to Baptista that sooner or
later the secret must leak out.&nbsp; As it was, she suspected that
at any rate she had not heard the last of the glazier.</p>
<p>In a day or two, when her husband had gone to the old town on the
other side of the island, there came a gentle tap at the door, and the
worthy witness of her first marriage made his appearance a second time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It took me hours to get to the bottom of the mystery&mdash;hours!&rsquo;
he said with a gaze of deep confederacy which offended her pride very
deeply.&nbsp; &lsquo;But thanks to a good intellect I&rsquo;ve done
it.&nbsp; Now, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m not a man to tell tales, even
when a tale would be so good as this.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m going back
to the mainland again, and a little assistance would be as rain on thirsty
ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I helped you two days ago,&rsquo; began Baptista.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;but what was that, my good lady?&nbsp; Not enough
to pay my passage to Pen-zephyr.&nbsp; I came over on your account,
for I thought there was a mystery somewhere.&nbsp; Now I must go back
on my own.&nbsp; Mind this&mdash;&rsquo;twould be very awkward for you
if your old man were to know.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a queer temper, though
he may be fond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knew as well as her visitor how awkward it would be; and the
hush-money she paid was heavy that day.&nbsp; She had, however, the
satisfaction of watching the man to the steamer, and seeing him diminish
out of sight.&nbsp; But Baptista perceived that the system into which
she had been led of purchasing silence thus was one fatal to her peace
of mind, particularly if it had to be continued.</p>
<p>Hearing no more from the glazier she hoped the difficulty was past.&nbsp;
But another week only had gone by, when, as she was pacing the Giant&rsquo;s
Walk (the name given to the promenade), she met the same personage in
the company of a fat woman carrying a bundle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the lady, my dear,&rsquo; he said to his companion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This, ma&rsquo;am, is my wife.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve come to settle
in the town for a time, if so be we can find room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody
can live here who is not privileged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am privileged,&rsquo; said the glazier, &lsquo;by my trade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baptista went on, but in the afternoon she received a visit from
the man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; This honest woman began to depict, in forcible
colours, the necessity for keeping up the concealment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will intercede with my husband, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a true man if rightly managed; and I&rsquo;ll
beg him to consider your position.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a very nice house
you&rsquo;ve got here,&rsquo; she added, glancing round, &lsquo;and
well worth a little sacrifice to keep it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unlucky Baptista staved off the danger on this third occasion
as she had done on the previous two.&nbsp; But she formed a resolve
that, if the attack were once more to be repeated she would face a revelation&mdash;worse
though that must now be than before she had attempted to purchase silence
by bribes.&nbsp; Her tormentors, never believing her capable of acting
upon such an intention, came again; but she shut the door in their faces.&nbsp;
They retreated, muttering something; but she went to the back of the
house, where David Heddegan was.</p>
<p>She looked at him, unconscious of all.&nbsp; The case was serious;
she knew that well; and all the more serious in that she liked him better
now than she had done at first.&nbsp; Yet, as she herself began to see,
the secret was one that was sure to disclose itself.&nbsp; Her name
and Charles&rsquo;s stood indelibly written in the registers; and though
a month only had passed as yet it was a wonder that his clandestine
union with her had not already been discovered by his friends.&nbsp;
Thus spurring herself to the inevitable, she spoke to Heddegan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;David, come indoors.&nbsp; I have something to tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He hardly regarded her at first.&nbsp; She had discerned that during
the last week or two he had seemed preoccupied, as if some private business
harassed him.&nbsp; She repeated her request.&nbsp; He replied with
a sigh, &lsquo;Yes, certainly, mee deer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they had reached the sitting-room and shut the door she repeated,
faintly, &lsquo;David, I have something to tell you&mdash;a sort of
tragedy I have concealed.&nbsp; You will hate me for having so far deceived
you; but perhaps my telling you voluntarily will make you think a little
better of me than you would do otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tragedy?&rsquo; he said, awakening to interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much
you can know about tragedies, mee deer, that have been in the world
so short a time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw that he suspected nothing, and it made her task the harder.&nbsp;
But on she went steadily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is about something that happened
before we were married,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a very long time before&mdash;a short time.&nbsp; And
it is about a lover,&rsquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t much mind that,&rsquo; he said mildly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In truth, I was in hopes &rsquo;twas more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In hopes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This screwed her up to the necessary effort.&nbsp; &lsquo;I met my
old sweetheart.&nbsp; He scorned me, chid me, dared me, and I went and
married him.&nbsp; We were coming straight here to tell you all what
we had done; but he was drowned; and I thought I would say nothing about
him: and I married you, David, for the sake of peace and quietness.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it from you, but have found I cannot.&nbsp;
There&mdash;that&rsquo;s the substance of it, and you can never, never
forgive me, I am sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke desperately.&nbsp; But the old man, instead of turning
black or blue, or slaying her in his indignation, jumped up from his
chair, and began to caper around the room in quite an ecstatic emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, happy thing!&nbsp; How well it falls out!&rsquo; he exclaimed,
snapping his, fingers over his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha-ha&mdash;the knot
is cut&mdash;I see a way out of my trouble&mdash;ha-ha!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She looked at him without uttering a sound, till, as he still continued
smiling joyfully, she said, &lsquo;O&mdash;what do you mean!&nbsp; Is
it done to torment me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no!&nbsp; O, mee deer, your story helps me out of
the most heart-aching quandary a poor man ever found himself in!&nbsp;
You see, it is this&mdash;<i>I&rsquo;ve</i> got a tragedy, too; and
unless you had had one to tell, I could never have seen my way to tell
mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is yours&mdash;what is it?&rsquo; she asked, with altogether
a new view of things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;it is a bouncer; mine is a bouncer!&rsquo; said
he, looking on the ground and wiping his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not worse than mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;that depends upon how you look at it.&nbsp; Yours
had to do with the past alone; and I don&rsquo;t mind it.&nbsp; You
see, we&rsquo;ve been married a month, and it don&rsquo;t jar upon me
as it would if we&rsquo;d only been married a day or two.&nbsp; Now
mine refers to past, present, and future; so that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Past, present, and future!&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
never occurred to me that <i>you</i> had a tragedy, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have!&rsquo; he said, shaking his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
fact, four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then tell &rsquo;em!&rsquo; cried the young woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will&mdash;I will.&nbsp; But be considerate, I beg &rsquo;ee,
mee deer.&nbsp; Well&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t a bachelor when I married
&rsquo;ee, any more than you were a spinster.&nbsp; Just as you was
a widow-woman, I was a widow-man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said she, with some surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
is that all?&mdash;then we are nicely balanced,&rsquo; she added, relieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;it is not all.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the point.&nbsp;
I am not only a widower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, David!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a widower with four tragedies&mdash;that is to say, four
strapping girls&mdash;the eldest taller than you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee look so struck&mdash;dumb-like!&nbsp; It fell out in this
way.&nbsp; I knew the poor woman, their mother, in Pen-zephyr for some
years; and&mdash;to cut a long story short&mdash;I privately married
her at last, just before she died.&nbsp; I kept the matter secret, but
it is getting known among the people here by degrees.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
long felt for the children&mdash;that it is my duty to have them here,
and do something for them.&nbsp; I have not had courage to break it
to &rsquo;ee, but I&rsquo;ve seen lately that it would soon come to
your ears, and that hev worried me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they educated?&rsquo; said the ex-schoolmistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I am sorry to say they have been much neglected;
in truth, they can hardly read.&nbsp; And so I thought that by marrying
a young schoolmistress I should get some one in the house who could
teach &rsquo;em, and bring &rsquo;em into genteel condition, all for
nothing.&nbsp; You see, they are growed up too tall to be sent to school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, mercy!&rsquo; she almost moaned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Four great
girls to teach the rudiments to, and have always in the house with me
spelling over their books; and I hate teaching, it kills me.&nbsp; I
am bitterly punished&mdash;I am, I am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to &rsquo;em, mee deer, and the balance
of secrets&mdash;mine against yours&mdash;will comfort your heart with
a sense of justice.&nbsp; I could send for &rsquo;em this week very
well&mdash;and I will!&nbsp; In faith, I could send this very day.&nbsp;
Baptista, you have relieved me of all my difficulty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus the interview ended, so far as this matter was concerned.&nbsp;
Baptista was too stupefied to say more, and when she went away to her
room she wept from very mortification at Mr. Heddegan&rsquo;s duplicity.&nbsp;
Education, the one thing she abhorred; the shame of it to delude a young
wife so!</p>
<p>The next meal came round.&nbsp; As they sat, Baptista would not suffer
her eyes to turn towards him.&nbsp; He did not attempt to intrude upon
her reserve, but every now and then looked under the table and chuckled
with satisfaction at the aspect of affairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;How very well
matched we be!&rsquo; he said, comfortably.</p>
<p>Next day, when the steamer came in, Baptista saw her husband rush
down to meet it; and soon after there appeared at her door four tall,
hipless, shoulderless girls, dwindling in height and size from the eldest
to the youngest, like a row of Pan pipes; at the head of them standing
Heddegan.&nbsp; He smiled pleasantly through the grey fringe of his
whiskers and beard, and turning to the girls said, &lsquo;Now come forrard,
and shake hands properly with your stepmother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus she made their acquaintance, and he went out, leaving them together.&nbsp;
On examination the poor girls turned out to be not only plain-looking,
which she could have forgiven, but to have such a lamentably meagre
intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions.&nbsp;
Even the eldest, almost her own age, could only read with difficulty
words of two syllables; and taste in dress was beyond their comprehension.&nbsp;
In the long vista of future years she saw nothing but dreary drudgery
at her detested old trade without prospect of reward.</p>
<p>She went about quite despairing during the next few days&mdash;an
unpromising, unfortunate mood for a woman who had not been married six
weeks.&nbsp; From her parents she concealed everything.&nbsp; They had
been amongst the few acquaintances of Heddegan who knew nothing of his
secret, and were indignant enough when they saw such a ready-made household
foisted upon their only child.&nbsp; But she would not support them
in their remonstrances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t yet know all,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Thus Baptista had sense enough to see the retributive fairness of
this issue.&nbsp; For some time, whenever conversation arose between
her and Heddegan, which was not often, she always said, &lsquo;I am
miserable, and you know it.&nbsp; Yet I don&rsquo;t wish things to be
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But one day when he asked, &lsquo;How do you like &rsquo;em now?&rsquo;
her answer was unexpected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much better than I did,&rsquo;
she said, quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may like them very much some day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a serener season for the chastened spirit
of Baptista Heddegan.&nbsp; She had, in truth, discovered, underneath
the crust of uncouthness and meagre articulation which was due to their
Troglodytean existence, that her unwelcomed daughters had natures that
were unselfish almost to sublimity.&nbsp; The harsh discipline accorded
to their young lives before their mother&rsquo;s wrong had been righted,
had operated less to crush them than to lift them above all personal
ambition.&nbsp; They considered the world and its contents in a purely
objective way, and their own lot seemed only to affect them as that
of certain human beings among the rest, whose troubles they knew rather
than suffered.</p>
<p>This was such an entirely new way of regarding life to a woman of
Baptista&rsquo;s nature, that her attention, from being first arrested
by it, became deeply interested.&nbsp; By imperceptible pulses her heart
expanded in sympathy with theirs.&nbsp; The sentences of her tragi-comedy,
her life, confused till now, became clearer daily.&nbsp; That in humanity,
as exemplified by these girls, there was nothing to dislike, but infinitely
much to pity, she learnt with the lapse of each week in their company.&nbsp;
She grew to like the girls of unpromising exterior, and from liking
she got to love them; till they formed an unexpected point of junction
between her own and her husband&rsquo;s interests, generating a sterling
friendship at least, between a pair in whose existence there had threatened
to be neither friendship nor love.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
