<h3>PREFACE</h3>
</center>
<br>
<p>In reprinting this story for a new edition I am reminded that it was
in the chapters of "Far from the Madding Crowd," as they appeared
month by month in a popular magazine, that I first ventured to adopt
the word "Wessex" from the pages of early English history, and give
it a fictitious significance as the existing name of the district
once included in that extinct kingdom.  The series of novels I
projected being mainly of the kind called local, they seemed to
require a territorial definition of some sort to lend unity to their
scene.  Finding that the area of a single county did not afford a
canvas large enough for this purpose, and that there were objections
to an invented name, I disinterred the old one.  The press and the
public were kind enough to welcome the fanciful plan, and willingly
joined me in the anachronism of imagining a Wessex population living
under Queen Victoria;&mdash;a modern Wessex of railways,
the penny post, mowing and reaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer
matches, labourers who could read and write, and National school
children. But I believe I am correct in stating that, until the
existence of this contemporaneous Wessex was announced in the present
story, in 1874, it had never been heard of, and that the expression, "a
Wessex peasant," or "a Wessex custom," would theretofore have been
taken to refer to nothing later in date than the Norman Conquest.

<p>I did not anticipate that this application of the word to a modern
use would extend outside the chapters of my own chronicles.  But the
name was soon taken up elsewhere as a local designation.  The first
to do so was the now defunct <i>Examiner</i>, which, in the impression
bearing date July 15, 1876, entitled one of its articles "The Wessex
Labourer," the article turning out to be no dissertation on farming
during the Heptarchy, but on the modern peasant of the south-west
counties, and his presentation in these stories.

<p>Since then the appellation which I had thought to reserve to the
horizons and landscapes of a merely realistic dream-country, has
become more and more popular as a practical definition; and the
dream-country has, by degrees, solidified into a utilitarian region
which people can go to, take a house in, and write to the papers
from.  But I ask all good and gentle readers to be so kind as to
forget this, and to refuse steadfastly to believe that there are any
inhabitants of a Victorian Wessex outside the pages of this and the
companion volumes in which they were first discovered.

<p>Moreover, the village called Weatherbury, wherein the scenes of the
present story of the series are for the most part laid, would perhaps
be hardly discernible by the explorer, without help, in any existing
place nowadays; though at the time, comparatively recent, at which
the tale was written, a sufficient reality to meet the descriptions,
both of backgrounds and personages, might have been traced easily
enough.  The church remains, by great good fortune, unrestored and
intact, and a few of the old houses; but the ancient malt-house,
which was formerly so characteristic of the parish, has been pulled
down these twenty years; also most of the thatched and dormered
cottages that were once lifeholds.  The game of prisoner's base,
which not so long ago seemed to enjoy a perennial vitality in front
of the worn-out stocks, may, so far as I can say, be entirely unknown
to the rising generation of schoolboys there.  The practice of
divination by Bible and key, the regarding of valentines as things of
serious import, the shearing-supper, and the harvest-home, have, too,
nearly disappeared in the wake of the old houses; and with them have
gone, it is said, much of that love of fuddling to which the village
at one time was notoriously prone.  The change at the root of this
has been the recent supplanting of the class of stationary cottagers,
who carried on the local traditions and humours, by a population of
more or less migratory labourers, which has led to a break of
continuity in local history, more fatal than any other thing to the
preservation of legend, folk-lore, close inter-social relations, and
eccentric individualities.  For these the indispensable conditions of
existence are attachment to the soil of one particular spot by
generation after generation.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br>
<br>
Description of Farmer Oak&mdash;An Incident</h3>
</center>
<br>
<p>When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they
were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were
reduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them,
extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch
of the rising sun.

<p>His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young
man of sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good
character.  On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to
postponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella:  upon the
whole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space
of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the
parish and the drunken section,&mdash;that is, he went to church,
but yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene
creed, and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to
be listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood in
the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in
tantrums, he was considered rather a bad man; when they were pleased,
he was rather a good man; when they were neither, he was a man whose
moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.

<p>Since he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak's
appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own&mdash;the
mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always
dressed in that way.  He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at the
base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds, and a
coat like Dr. Johnson's; his lower extremities being encased in
ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large, affording to
each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand
in a river all day long and know nothing of damp&mdash;their maker
being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any
weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity.

<p>Mr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a
small silver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and
intention, and a small clock as to size. This instrument being
several years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity of
going either too fast or not at all.  The smaller of its hands, too,
occasionally slipped round on the pivot, and thus, though the minutes
were told with precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour
they belonged to.  The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied
by thumps and shakes, and he escaped any evil consequences from the
other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of
the sun and stars, and by pressing his face close to the glass of his
neighbours' windows, till he could discern the hour marked by the
green-faced timekeepers within.  It may be mentioned that Oak's fob
being difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high situation
in the waistband of his trousers (which also lay at a remote height
under his waistcoat), the watch was as a necessity pulled out by
throwing the body to one side, compressing the mouth and face to a
mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion required, and
drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a well.

<p>But some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one of
his fields on a certain December morning&mdash;sunny and exceedingly
mild&mdash;might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than
these. In his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of
youth had tarried on to manhood: there even remained in his remoter
crannies some relics of the boy.  His height and breadth would have
been sufficient to make his presence imposing, had they been exhibited
with due consideration.  But there is a way some men have, rural and
urban alike, for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and
sinew:  it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their manner of
showing them.  And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no
great claim on the world's room, Oak walked unassumingly and with a
faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.
This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his
valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well,
which Oak did not.

<p>He had just reached the time of life at which "young" is ceasing to
be the prefix of "man" in speaking of one. He was at the brightest
period of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were
clearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence
of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse,
and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united
again, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and
family.  In short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.

<p>The field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe
Hill.  Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster
and Chalk-Newton.  Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming
down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted
yellow and gaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking
alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly.  The waggon was laden with
household goods and window plants, and on the apex of the whole sat a
woman, young and attractive.  Gabriel had not beheld the sight for
more than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill
just beneath his eyes.

<p>"The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss," said the waggoner.

<p>"Then I heard it fall," said the girl, in a soft, though not
particularly low voice.  "I heard a noise I could not account for
when we were coming up the hill."

<p>"I'll run back."

<p>"Do," she answered.

<p>The sensible horses stood&mdash;perfectly still, and the waggoner's
steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.

<p>The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by
tables and chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle,
and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses,
together with a caged canary&mdash;all probably from the windows of
the house just vacated.  There was also a cat in a willow basket, from
the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and
affectionately surveyed the small birds around.

<p>The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the
only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up
and down the perches of its prison.  Then she looked attentively
downwards.  It was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an
oblong package tied in paper, and lying between them.  She turned her
head to learn if the waggoner were coming.  He was not yet in sight;
and her eyes crept back to the package, her thoughts seeming to run
upon what was inside it.  At length she drew the article into her
lap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing looking-glass was
disclosed, in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively.  She
parted her lips and smiled.

<p>It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the
crimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright
face and dark hair.  The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed
around her were fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they
invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl
with a peculiar vernal charm.  What possessed her to indulge in such
a performance in the sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and
unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators,&mdash;whether the
smile began as a factitious one, to test her capacity in that
art,&mdash;nobody knows; it ended certainly in a real smile.  She
blushed at herself, and seeing her reflection blush, blushed the more.

<p>The change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an
act&mdash;from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling
out of doors&mdash;lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not
intrinsically possess.  The picture was a delicate one.  Woman's
prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had clothed
it in the freshness of an originality.  A cynical inference was
irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though
he fain would have been.  There was no necessity whatever for her
looking in the glass.  She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or
press a dimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such
intention had been her motive in taking up the glass.  She simply
observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her
thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which
men would play a part&mdash;vistas of probable triumphs&mdash;the
smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost
and won. Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of
actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that
intention had any part in them at all.

<p>The waggoner's steps were heard returning.  She put the glass in the
paper, and the whole again into its place.

<p>When the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of
espial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the
turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the
object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll.
About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he
heard a dispute.  It was a difference concerning twopence between the
persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.
you would wish me not to when I told 'ee or I shouldn't ha'
thought of doing it," he said, simply.  "I have arranged for
Little Weatherbury Farm and shall have it in my own hands at
Lady-day.  You know I've had a share in it for some time.
Still, that wouldn't prevent my attending to your business
as before, hadn't it been that things have been said about
us."

<p>"What?" said Bathsheba, in surprise.  "Things said about you
and me!  What are they?"

<p>"I cannot tell you."

<p>"It would be wiser if you were to, I think.  You have played
the part of mentor to me many times, and I don't see why you
should fear to do it now."

<p>"It is nothing that you have done, this time.  The top and
tail o't is this&mdash;that I am sniffing about here, and
waiting for poor Boldwood's farm, with a thought of getting
you some day."

<p>"Getting me!  What does that mean?"

<p>"Marrying of 'ee, in plain British.  You asked me to tell,
so you mustn't blame me."

<p>Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had
been discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected.
"Marrying me!  I didn't know it was that you meant," she
said, quietly.  "Such a thing as that is too absurd&mdash;too
soon&mdash;to think of, by far!"

<p>"Yes; of course, it is too absurd.  I don't desire any such
thing; I should think that was plain enough by this time.
Surely, surely you be the last person in the world I think
of marrying.  It is too absurd, as you say."

<p>"'Too&mdash;s-s-soon' were the words I used."

<p>"I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said,
'too absurd,' and so do I."

<p>"I beg your pardon too!" she returned, with tears in her
eyes.  "'Too soon' was what I said.  But it doesn't matter a
bit&mdash;not at all&mdash;but I only meant, 'too soon.'  Indeed,
I didn't, Mr. Oak, and you must believe me!"

<p>Gabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being
faint there was not much to be seen.  "Bathsheba," he said,
tenderly and in surprise, and coming closer: "if I only knew
one thing&mdash;whether you would allow me to love you and win
you, and marry you after all&mdash;if I only knew that!"

<p>"But you never will know," she murmured.

<p>"Why?"

<p>"Because you never ask."

<p>"Oh&mdash;Oh!" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness.
"My own dear&mdash;"

<p>"You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this
morning," she interrupted.  "It shows you didn't care a bit
about me, and were ready to desert me like all the rest of
them!  It was very cruel of you, considering I was the first
sweetheart that you ever had, and you were the first I ever
had; and I shall not forget it!"

<p>"Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking," he said,
laughing.  "You know it was purely that I, as an unmarried
man, carrying on a business for you as a very taking young
woman, had a proper hard part to play&mdash;more particular
that people knew I had a sort of feeling for 'ee; and I
fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it
might injure your good name.  Nobody knows the heat and fret
I have been caused by it."

<p>"And was that all?"

<p>"All."

<p>"Oh, how glad I am I came!" she exclaimed, thankfully, as
she rose from her seat.  "I have thought so much more of you
since I fancied you did not want even to see me again.  But
I must be going now, or I shall be missed.  Why Gabriel,"
she said, with a slight laugh, as they went to the door, "it
seems exactly as if I had come courting you&mdash;how
dreadful!"

<p>"And quite right too," said Oak.  "I've danced at your
skittish heels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long
mile, and many a long day; and it is hard to begrudge me
this one visit."

<p>He accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the
details of his forthcoming tenure of the other farm.  They
spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases
and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such
tried friends.  Theirs was that substantial affection which
arises (if any arises at all) when the two who are thrown
together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each
other's character, and not the best till further on, the
romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard
prosaic reality.  This
good-fellowship&mdash;<i>camaraderie</i>&mdash;usually
occurring through similarity of pursuits, is
unfortunately seldom superadded to love between the sexes,
because men and women associate, not in their labours, but
in their pleasures merely.  Where, however, happy
circumstance permits its development, the compounded feeling
proves itself to be the only love which is strong as
death&mdash;that love which many waters
cannot quench, nor the floods
drown, beside which the passion usually called by the name
is evanescent as steam.

<h3>CHAPTER LVII<br>
<br>
A FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</center>
<br>
<p>"The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is
possible to have."

<p>Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some
time after the event of the preceding chapter, and he
meditated a full hour by the clock upon how to carry out her
wishes to the letter.

<p>"A license&mdash;O yes, it must be a license," he said to
himself at last.  "Very well, then; first, a license."

<p>On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious
steps from the surrogate's door, in Casterbridge.  On the
way home he heard a heavy tread in front of him, and,
overtaking the man, found him to be Coggan.  They walked
together into the village until they came to a little lane
behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban
Tall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish,
and was yet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he
heard his lone voice among certain hard words of the Psalms,
whither no man ventured to follow him.

<p>"Well, good-night, Coggan," said Oak, "I'm going down this
way."

<p>"Oh!" said Coggan, surprised; "what's going on to-night
then, make so bold Mr. Oak?"

<p>It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the
circumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through
the time of Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and
Gabriel said, "You can keep a secret, Coggan?"

<p>"You've proved me, and you know."

<p>"Yes, I have, and I do know.  Well, then, mistress and I
mean to get married to-morrow morning."

<p>"Heaven's high tower!  And yet I've thought of such a thing
from time to time; true, I have.  But keeping it so close!
Well, there, 'tis no consarn of of mine, and I wish 'ee joy
o' her."

<p>"Thank you, Coggan.  But I assure 'ee that this great hush
is not what I wished for at all, or what either of us would
have wished if it hadn't been for certain things that would
make a gay wedding seem hardly the thing.  Bathsheba has a
great wish that all the parish shall not be in church,
looking at her&mdash;she's shy-like and nervous about it, in
fact&mdash;so I be doing this to humour her."

<p>"Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say.  And you
be now going down to the clerk."

<p>"Yes; you may as well come with me."

<p>"I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed
away," said Coggan, as they walked along.  "Labe Tall's old
woman will horn it all over parish in half-an-hour."

<p>"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that," said
Oak, pausing.  "Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for
he's working so far off, and leaves early."

<p>"I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her," said Coggan.  "I'll
knock and ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you
standing in the background.  Then he'll come out, and you
can tell yer tale.  She'll never guess what I want en for;
and I'll make up a few words about the farm-work, as a
blind."

<p>This scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced
boldly, and rapped at Mrs. Tall's door.  Mrs. Tall herself
opened it.

<p>"I wanted to have a word with Laban."

<p>"He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock.
He've been forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out
work.  I shall do quite as well."

<p>"I hardly think you will.  Stop a moment;" and Coggan
stepped round the corner of the porch to consult Oak.

<p>"Who's t'other man, then?" said Mrs. Tall.

<p>"Only a friend," said Coggan.

<p>"Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch
to-morrow morning at ten," said Oak, in a whisper.  "That he
must come without fail, and wear his best clothes."

<p>"The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!" said Coggan.

<p>"It can't be helped," said Oak.  "Tell her."

<p>So Coggan delivered the message.  "Mind, het or wet, blow or
snow, he must come," added Jan.  "'Tis very particular,
indeed.  The fact is, 'tis to witness her sign some law-work
about taking shares wi' another farmer for a long span o'
years.  There, that's what 'tis, and now I've told 'ee,
Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done if I hadn't loved
'ee so hopeless well."

<p>Coggan retired before she could ask any further; and next
they called at the vicar's in a manner which excited no
curiosity at all.  Then Gabriel went home, and prepared for
the morrow.


<br><br><br>
<p>"Liddy," said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, "I want
you to call me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I
shouldn't wake."

<p>"But you always do wake afore then, ma'am."

<p>"Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell
you of when the time comes, and it's best to make sure."

<p>Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she
by any contrivance get to sleep again.  About six, being
quite positive that her watch had stopped during the night,
she could wait no longer.  She went and tapped at Liddy's
door, and after some labour awoke her.

<p>"But I thought it was I who had to call you?" said the
bewildered Liddy.  "And it isn't six yet."

<p>"Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?  I know
it must be ever so much past seven.  Come to my room as soon
as you can; I want you to give my hair a good brushing."

<p>When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already
waiting.  Liddy could not understand this extraordinary
promptness.  "Whatever <i>is</i> going on, ma'am?" she said.

<p>"Well, I'll tell you," said Bathsheba, with a mischievous
smile in her bright eyes.  "Farmer Oak is coming here to
dine with me to-day!"

<p>"Farmer Oak&mdash;and nobody else?&mdash;you two alone?"

<p>"Yes."

<p>"But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?" asked her
companion, dubiously.  "A woman's good name is such a
perishable article that&mdash;"

<p>Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in
Liddy's ear, although there was nobody present.  Then Liddy
stared and exclaimed, "Souls alive, what news!  It makes my
heart go quite bumpity-bump!"

<p>"It makes mine rather furious, too," said Bathsheba.
"However, there's no getting out of it now!"

<p>It was a damp disagreeable morning.  Nevertheless, at twenty
minutes to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and


<br><br><br>
<blockquote><blockquote>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Went up the hill side<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     With that sort of stride<br>
     A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,<br>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<br>


and knocked Bathsheba's door.  Ten minutes later a large and
a smaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same
door, and through the mist along the road to the church.
The distance was not more than a quarter of a mile, and
these two sensible persons deemed it unnecessary to drive.
An observer must have been very close indeed to discover
that the forms under the umbrellas were those of Oak and
Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak
in a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a
cloak that reached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly
dressed, there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about
her:&mdash;


<br><br><br>
<blockquote><blockquote>
     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.
</blockquote></blockquote>
<br>


<p>Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at
Gabriel's request, arranged her hair this morning as she had
worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes
remarkably like a girl of that fascinating dream, which,
considering that she was now only three or four-and-twenty,
was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the church were Tall,
Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short space of
time the deed was done.

<p>The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour
in the evening of the same day, for it had been arranged
that Farmer Oak should go there to live, since he had as yet
neither money, house, nor furniture worthy of the name,
though he was on a sure way towards them, whilst Bathsheba
was, comparatively, in a plethora of all three.

<p>Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears
were greeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what
seemed like a tremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front
of the house.

<p>"There!" said Oak, laughing, "I knew those fellows were up
to something, by the look on their faces"

<p>Oak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by
Bathsheba with a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a
group of male figures gathered upon the gravel in front,
who, when they saw the newly-married couple in the porch,
set up a loud "Hurrah!" and at the same moment bang again
went the cannon in the background, followed by a hideous
clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,
hautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass&mdash;the only remaining
relics of the true and original
Weatherbury band&mdash;venerable worm-eaten
instruments, which had celebrated in
their own persons the victories of Marlborough, under the
fingers of the forefathers of those who played them now.
The performers came forward, and marched up to the front.

<p>"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of
all this," said Oak.  "Come in, souls, and have something to
eat and drink wi' me and my wife."

<p>"Not to-night," said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.
"Thank ye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly
time.  However, we couldn't think of letting the day pass
without a note of admiration of some sort.  If ye could send
a drop of som'at down to Warren's, why so it is.  Here's
long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and his comely
bride!"

<p>"Thank ye; thank ye all," said Gabriel.  "A bit and a drop
shall be sent to Warren's for ye at once.  I had a thought
that we might very likely get a salute of some sort from our
old friends, and I was saying so to my wife but now."

<p>"Faith," said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his
companions, "the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a
wonderful naterel way, considering how very youthful he is
in wedlock as yet&mdash;hey, neighbours all?"

<p>"I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years'
standing pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,"
said Jacob Smallbury.  "It might have been a little more
true to nater if't had been spoke a little chillier, but
that wasn't to be expected just now."

<p>"That improvement will come wi' time," said Jan, twirling
his eye.

<p>Then Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never
laughed readily now), and their friends turned to go.

<p>"Yes; I suppose that's the size o't," said Joseph Poorgrass
with a cheerful sigh as they moved away; "and I wish him joy
o' her; though I were once or twice upon saying to-day with
holy Hosea, in my scripture manner, which is my second
nature, 'Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.'  But
since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have been worse, and I feel
my thanks accordingly."

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
